They have left the best of architects and pioneering design engineers intrigued and in unresolvable wonder. What they cannot unravel is when one minaret is shaken the other begins to vibrate, though the connecting passage between the two remains vibration-free; what causes this vibration is unknown. There are two well-known pairs of Shaking Minarets in Ahmedabad, one located opposite the Sarangpur Darwaja and the other near the Kalupur Railway Station Area. The one near Sarangpur Darwaja is within the vicinity of the Sidi Bashir Mosque built in 1452 AD by Sidi Bashir, a slave of Sultan Ahmed Shah. They are three storeys tall with carved balconies where visitors were once allowed to climb all the way up. The other set of minarets near the Railway Station is taller in height. However, these are not in a very good condition as it is believed that the British had dismantled them to understand the cause of vibrations.

The museum is good, especially the paintings of Raja Ravi Varma. When you look closely, the detailing will blow your mind. The arrangement is also done very neatly.

Welcome to the holy city of Mahadev.🙏
You are currently in Gita Mandir. Located less than 1.8 kilometers away from Somnath Temple. Who am I to speak about the city of Mahadev.
हर हर महादेव🙏
This is the most peaceful place in the somnath. This Gita Temple is devoted to Lord Vishnu and Devi Laxmi. There are 4-5 other temple all related to Mahabharata & Lord Krishna in its premises. Surrounding is very pleasant here. One should visit here and spend some time whenever they visit somnath. The pleasent vibe here makes you feel good and calm.🤗
Regret to see that the place is not in good condition. Local administration should pay attention to improve the site, do renovations etc.🙏

Full History :-
Dedicated to Lord Shri Krishna, the current structure of Gita Mandir was built in the year of 1970 by Birla Group. As per mythology, Gita Mandir is situated at the very exact spot where Lord Sri Krishna took rest after his walk from Bhalka Theerth to Triveni Theerth, before his journey to Neej Dham at Dehotsarg. This incident happened after he was hit by an arrow, towards the end of Dwapara Yuga and Lord Krishna proceeded to heaven from this place.
हर हर महादेव🙏
Known for its wonderful architecture carved out of white marbles, the Gita Mandir enshrines the idol of Lord Krishna in its sanctum. The presiding deity is flanked by two idols of Lord Laxminarayan and Lord Sita-Ram. The footprint of Lord Shri Krishna is carved here to mark the divine memory of Shri Krishna Neejdham Prasthan Leela. The Mandir is famous for its depiction of the Bhagwat Gita, which is carved out on 18 marble pillars. The interiors of the temple are decorated with several aesthetic paintings of Lord Krishna. The temple was constructed with marble in such a way that one can hear the echo of his voice inside the temple.
हर हर महादेव🙏
One can also visit Shri Lakshminarayan Temple, which is situated on the banks of Hiran River. Dedicated to Lord Lakshminarayan, this temple is said to be the replica of the Lakshminarayan temple of Badrinath.

The final robotic dance was really enjoyed by kids.",,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNsvXoxpQBk7KDRgza8Nnl_sTGxLT6PSbr9NV7U=w1920-h1080-k-no,aquatic,,,21,,0,0,Gujarat Science City - Wikipedia,,33,15,0,16,14,coal mine,,,10,36,,Wednesday,,,,0,4.7,Thursday,True,,14,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPIKPAIa8wSWz_CGlJjGQG-uZkLG9peq6JxyLkz=w150-h150-k-no-p,18,,12,,Monday,9,,11,,,39,,,4.4,,47,0,8,16,,0,,18,34,0,,"Thaltej, Ahmedabad, Gujarat 380060, India",,23700,0,0,False,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMCvFDpBfOKDi75mzuSDmwDpxhUOW6KMB6-ZZbC=w1920-h1080-k-no,10,14,,Astronomy & Space Science Gallery,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMl40l7RUjUrLjMRXe_9oX0iw8JFADZ-n1QUEm1=w1920-h1080-k-no,30,0,2023-03-17T17:43:47.719Z,18,,,11,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Science+City+Ahmedabad/@23.0802008,72.4952437,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x395e9d8f9ac3ec17:0xf955692e13272fcf!8m2!3d23.0802008!4d72.4952437!16s%2Fm%2F02xc9xp?hl=en",21,17,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOCHAMmA8D8Gzc9z-7ueLvh7Pl0Bw-y8W0dD_f7=w150-h150-k-no-p,19,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMRQmjR0NxvLpsVm3K7PmZrUPmh43mTGazglWFJ=w1920-h1080-k-no,,15,23,,,0,9,21,,ChIJF-zDmo-dXjkRzy8nEy5pVfk,,a month ago,DJ SIR,22,2023-02-12T09:36:46.583Z,5,,,,,35,19,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNt-ZLW6-RxID4KE9MKeIIechbmAhngX7WCabrL=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,9,,,0,7,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107545317841081921129?hl=en-US,31,,,,Science City Gate No 2,39,14,,,0,,0,,True,23,,1,,False,170,Tourist attraction,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMjivMPxBdcybgr_Ucv3-tT5pBOBPMadqLzkGbZ=w1920-h1080-k-no,32,,10 AM to 7 PM,6,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPTjNOG-0TnFmy8Yvhhn_Sf2hEH9UeZbGXYxJah=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,6,"👋 Hey every Body,

Our family visited The science city, Ahmedabad. The Science City is very good place for children.

We visited only two eminities ( activities/section)
1.) Aquarium
2.) Robotics

First we visited Robotics section. Children and adults both enjoyed well and knowing uses of many different types of robots. Then there was a dance of the robots but due to lack of time we did not attended.

Then after we have some light breakfast from the inner Cafe etc...

Then we entered in the aquarium. It's very big aquarium.  We enjoyed lots. We see lots of different type of 🐟 fishes. We clicked lots of pictures 📸 📷 .

It's amazing science city.

Thank You 😊",13,36,Food & Drink,32,,,12,,,0,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO-pF3bqm7FypmEjyUH8Y_dmeU_NKHUZPPa7JAz=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,,,8,0,22,,a month ago,,Gujarat,8,

Firstly, parking is very far from temple, you needs to walk through dirty market to reach Temple. You will find lots of garbages around it.
When you reach Temple then prepare to stand in multiple queues. 1st one is to submit your mobile phones, electronic watches and luggage. Once done, then stand in another long queue to deposit your shoes. Now, third queue is to enter temple. Depending upon seaso  you may end-up standing for an hours. Police personals don't know how to manage crowds. During my visit they were busy providing treatment to the VIP Guests who was an IG. There is a separate queue for Male and Female, so you will not be with your family in Temple. Once you enter core of Temple, you will feel lost as you don't know from where male queue will start. There is no signed board or clear demarcation. Ppl will come in between queues and even you will find females in Male queues too. Too much rush and poor management.

Goddess Krishna is very beautiful, so don't miss  that.",,,,,,,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOxWpSkoGB1Q2UZz5DjajhcEthIVIDxAKLG58Ex=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,,,,,,,2 months ago,,Gujarat,,

કચ્છ ની લોકજાતી એક બીજા થી રહેણી કહેણી માં કઈ રીતે અલગ છે તેની મૂર્ત રૂપ આપી સમજવા માં આવ્યું છે.

સંગ્રહાલય, હમીરસર તળાવ પાસે જ હોય એક મુખ્ય પર્યટક સ્થળ છે.

ત્યાં લિફ્ટ ની સુવિધા નથી માટે પહેલો માળ જોવા દાદરા નો ઉપયોગ કરવો પડે જે વરિષ્ઠ નાગરિકો એ મુલાકાત લેતા પહેલા ધ્યાન માં રાખવું.

Very peaceful and good ambiance. Lots of people coming from pan India to visit the lord Krishna and his kingdom. You have to wait to visit the temple as the huge public/devotees come to take god's blessings. But inside security don't allow anyone to stay more than seconds as they ask to leave as quickly as possible which is totally unfair as devotees coming from long distance to visit but unable to do it properly because of such security.

""Being a Gujarati, I thought I should be able to render the greatest services to the country through the Gujarati language. And then as Ahmedabad was an ancient centre of hand loom weaving, it was likely to be most favourable field for the revival of the cottage industry of hand spinning. There was also a hope that, the city being capital of Gujarat, monetary help from its wealthy citizens would be more available than any other place"".

This was an explanation given by Gandhiji for choosing Ahmedabad as is hub of activities.

Gandhiji selected a place on the bank of the river Sabarmati very close to the Saint Dadheechi’s temple as well as from Jail and a crematorium. Gandhi used to remark, ""This is the right place for our activities to carry on the search for Truth and develop Fearlessness for on one side are the iron bolts of the foreigners and on the other, thunderbolts of mother nature."" After building a few essential structures, activities of the Ashram commenced in 1917.

Gandhiji had driven all the major activities of independence as well as upliftment of the society from this Ashram which was popularly known as Sabarmati Ashram. He stayed in the ashram for many years before he finally proceeded for a march to Dandi to break the salt law on 12 March 1930. Before starting the march to Dandi, Gandhiji declared that he will not return to the ashram before the independence of the country.

The Gandhi Smarak Sangrahalaya is run by a public trust established in 1951. The museum’s new premises were built in 1963. The museum’s main objective is to house the personal memorabilia of Mahatma Gandhi. Consequently the exhibits on view depict the vivid and historic events of Gandhiji’s life. There are books, manuscripts and photocopies of his correspondence, photographs of Gandhiji with his wife Kasturba and other ashram associates, life size oil paintings and actual relics like his writing desk and spinning wheel.",,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPMSRKJ6l6ECAQoeCxoM8DoN_FbtdBGT8NQRtjD=w1920-h1080-k-no,khadi,,,0,,0,0,History of Gandhi Ashram at Sabarmati,,0,,0,16,209,monument,,,66,51,,Wednesday,,,,0,4.5,Thursday,,0,14,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO00ho-59c5TfYH62aBq__-AE1FOdnDSxmbMLwr=w150-h150-k-no-p,18,12,12,,Monday,9,,11,,,86,,,4.6,,1161,0,8,16,,0,,18,79,0,,"Gandhi Smarak Sangrahalaya, Ashram Rd, Ahmedabad, Gujarat 380027, India",,117343,0,0,False,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNx-16WPaxcwazSbRrJSGP1-V15FfP4lfw58_70=w1920-h1080-k-no,10,33,8,Sant Shri Asharamji Ashram,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMwYsWyYtdDX1zEtBc_qJYAKSkBbHL51LYHqZp_=w1920-h1080-k-no,0,0,2023-03-17T17:54:35.511Z,18,,સાબરમતી આશ્રમ,11,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sabarmati+Ashram/@23.0607723,72.5808868,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x395e8479e05f1901:0x16cbb1101e5729a3!8m2!3d23.0607723!4d72.5808868!16zL20vMDRiYmNk?hl=en",21,17,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOZk6Q5lUN8JpIiNP8fC85jKoXOTVF3t_WkAlMQ=w150-h150-k-no-p,19,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNK1pllsSvlOZ7d5Vss2LQO9yYH6Kz56ViHiF-V=w1920-h1080-k-no,,15,23,,,0,46,21,0,ChIJARlf4HmEXjkRoylXHhCxyxY,,4 months ago,Irappa Deshanur,50,2023-01-02T04:11:13.669Z,5,People also search for,0,20,,56,19,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOmH3wANffr0aIyzvPmyOXzsWAxsnV2ifq-ST6K=w1920-h1080-k-no,,0,9,,,0,7,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113193869544439953278?hl=en-US,57,,,,Dandi Bridge,53,14,,7,0,,0,16,True,23,,,,False,3378,Tourist attraction,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP6aejnuZ6ITozdmExfB-zaJOd89VevxkwbaglC=w1920-h1080-k-no,53,,10 AM to 5 PM,6,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPC5Q_79N7CYwMS9H01D7oWFljB7taXfefipsb1=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,6,"A pleasant place.

It's a 1 day trip.

You can reach there 9-10AM also as the weather will be the same there in monsoon all the day.
There will be food like maggie, Corn and wafers. There are 3-4 restaurants also in highways (Ahmedabad to Zanzari) so you can eat after visiting waterfall.
You can swim there as water was clean enough.

Free bus service will take your to all the other attractions inside the city, as your cars are parked outside and not allowed in the city.
Travelator and escalators makes your trip comfortable. Evening laser show on the statue and light & sound show at the dam are must watch. Beautiful parks, zoo, glow garden, valley of flowers, cactus garden, jungle safari and lot more. Cycling tour on electric bike 🚴 is enjoyable and nice way to see some more attractions in a different way, electric bikes are effortless and cost you 800/- per person and normal cycle cost you 400/- per person.

First of all, people know this place as Pavagarh Kaali maata Mandir. There are 3 different sites- 2 masjids and 1 temple. Mashids are easilybaccessible by cab and cost just 40 bucks to enter for Indians. The mandir is another story. If you are in a small car, you must take the shared jeep going up and down. It's cheap but crowded. You can definitely hire a jeep by yourself. We paid 500 bucks for a jeep. Then you take the cable car(what they say as ropeway) up and down the landing spot. And then, finally, about 10-15 minute sof walk, about 250 steps up, and then a beautiful temple. It stands out on a clear blue sky and mild breeze. Was an ecstatic view, completely worth the effort. If you are religious, l, that's a cherry on the top as you get to do Darshan.

Oh, and I forgot, there are langoors / monkeys almost everywhere.

You get in your car, drive for miles, then get out and walk the remainder of the way to a waterfall. Civilization has cleared and marked a pathway for you and the many thousands like you who have come to enjoy these named landmarks. Rarely do you get to enjoy the natural beauty of one by just stepping out into your own backyard. Behind my house, barely noticeable, is a trail leading through the woods to a waterfall. The trail is narrow but well worn.

Any shrubbery that would have grown has been trampled down and all that is left is a very narrow path, overhung with branches from the trees that mark its sides. As I start down the trail, I begin to feel the trees closing around me until the house can no longer be seen. I follow the trail to where it stops at the creek's edge, approaching quietly so as not to disturb any of the wild creatures that has come to enjoy the cool fresh water. I gently cross over the creek using the stones, which show the wear of several previous crossing, so that I can have full view of the creek and the beauty it possesses. I can hear the rush of the water long before I see the falls.

As I sit down on the big gray slate rock that has been warmed by the early morning sun, I begin to gulp in the beauty as a starving man would gulp down food. I start my usual ritual of examining the banks of the creek by gazing down the right side of it first. I notice that the wild azaleas are in full bloom and that the trees have regained all their leaves. They stand tall and majestic as if they are soldiers standing guard.

My gaze travels up one of the trees to find two squirrels chattering down at me as if to say ""Go away and leave us in peace."" Further down starts the gentle bend that takes the remainder of the creek from my view. My gaze shifts to the left side of the bank and there lies an old oak tree that has fallen long ago. It still lies partially upon its stump so that it looks like the shape of an ""L"".",11,19,,17,1,10,10,2,,0,1,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOmk4D3ASlwzkpY_WiCXA8_de4xMFvq_IoBk7vU=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMRglCEclUMzQEVvgrOTDGs2hX8gIt-OGDMa6TO=w150-h150-k-no-p,,6,1,14,,2 months ago,1,Gujarat,6,9
