Can be visited as a picnic spot, also spending time with nature. We visited this place on a field trip from our college.
It is a good place to boost your knowledge about trees, bonsai gardens, medicinal plants and uses, aquatic plants, etc. You can witness different gardening patterns such as Japanese gardens.
Different types of cactus are also a sight of attraction. The natural rocks add serenity to the place. Plastics are prohibited on the campus, and they charge you if seen inside the campus. In short littering is prohibited.
Located on ranchi ringroad, lalkhatanga.

Happy visiting!

This is the place to go.
Ticket is ₹10 per person.
Do I want to go again? - Definitely
You will feel calm and natural bliss.
In the starting point, there are lots of small hotels. If you want to have lunch you have to tell them in advance before going to explore the waterfall.
There are around 500-600 stairs to reach the waterfall below. Once you reach the waterfall, I suggest you to stop for few mins and watch the waterfall. Don't start clicking pictures. Enjoy it with your eyes. BUT be careful with the rocks, as they can be slippery around the water.
NOTE - You will get two small kids there asking for food. Don't give them anything as they keep eating free of cost by asking every people who went there to visit the waterfall.",,"Abhi barish time ne Johna fall aana sahi hoga kya??

This was a series of paintings, sculptures, architecture, and tapestry of the Medieval and Early Renaissance as well as objects from the Middle East. This exhibit was an important part of the history of the Jharkhand Tribe Museum of Art. It gave me a good idea of what the paintings were like in these four centuries and reflected ideas of both the east and the  our old cultures .
I also observed many paintings in this gallery. One painting that caught my eye was titled, “The Mocking of labours ”. It was an early 11th century, oil on wood painting. Workers and Tribe was seen in the upper right next to families and was surrounded by figured who looked more like friends than enemies that would crucify him. These so called tribes of our old era that were holding weapons and wearing bizarre headgear. In many paintings, Tribes had a saddened look on his face while the others looked peculiar .

There is a boat ride. 7 or 9 seats atleast. So you have to pay 700 min for 7 people. There is a market also where you can buy various decorative items and eat a variety of food stuff.

You have to go once..
If you have plans for bathing go for it but also you have to know in middle of the pond the water is too dip and also snakes is in the pond (I don't see but i listen from someone).
There is also a railway track.
You can go and click pictures on this track.

There is not any charges.
Go for it i personally recommend you.

There is so much spot for photo shoot.

Good for taking pictures of sunrise and sunset and nothing more. There is no greenery and conditions of road is not good enough.
This place is created due to construction process of the road. The stones where taken from this place and deep places formed where waters gathered and made lakes. The place name is jhiri thats why its called jhiri lake. The roads to the lake are under construction even many people comes to see these places and good place to spend some time with friends but good to come in group.
This place is very pleasant and peaceful place to be, but you cannot go by Car.
Bike ride will be perfect way to go.
You can watch a beautiful sunset during winters.

A humble request to people visiting there, do not litter around any sort of waste and spoil the beauty of nature.

Good place for picknic. No antisocial elements around , no interference from local village residents. Surrounding is good for family and friends for day out or picnics

A small hangout place with friends and/or family and we all loved it and enjoyed. Will mention one thing only, keep the place clean and take the waste with you and dump at proper place. Don't disturb the nature.

It's a very beautiful lake .... Good for picnics and hangout with friends. The locals charge ₹10 for two wheeler's in the name of maintenance.
