There are some collectibles on display here whiich we’re found around the area near the caves.

Their are many temples around Badami which are more or less in ruined shape. Lots of figures seen at the museum are from those temples which were destroyed over time.

Good details have been put up there if you want to understand a little more about Badami and it’s caves and temples.

Right from here you can also hike up to the northern side of the Badami fort. There is no entrance fee for that.

A visit here would be good. Would take around 30 min to cover it. Their is a small parking lot in case you are taking your own vehicle.

You can also hire an auto to reach here.",13,33,Other,0,,,12,,0,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOLwJvers498_avTzrD2MtXgo05EUDuWMHFK0I5=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,,8,0,,,a month ago,,,Karnataka,,56

Can get very hot and Sunny in the afternoon.

We came here to spend some time while on the way back from Udupi, unfortunately was too hot and sunny. But we did walk to the end of the sea walk, there are no shades anywhere along the path way. Even the parking lot is open and gets very hot.

There are many stalls selling ice creams and refreshments. There is also a public restroom at the parking lot. Tickets to the St Mary’s Island need to be booked at the kiosk at the end of the parking lot. Expect long queues especially during holiday season.

The water channels are clean and the area generally well maintained. You can watch the fishing boats come and go from the harbour.

Formerly dated to the 7th or 8th century, it is now dated to about the 5th century. It is located to the south of the Durga temple, Aihole.

The temple shows clear signs of following early timber models, none of which have survived. This is seen for example in the construction of the roof of the mandapa. The temple consists of a shrine (garba griha) with a mandapa in front of it, and a covered path for circumambulating the sanctuary, seen in other very early temples. The mukha mandapa is situated in front of the sanctum and consists of a set of 12 carved pillars. The sabha mandapa leads to the maha mandapa and the pillars are arranged to form two concentric squares. The walls have floral patterns on them and the windows have lattice work done in the northern style. Facing the sanctum, a second smaller sanctum is situated above the center of the hall whose outer walls have many carved images.

Originally dedicated to Vishnu, now the main shrine houses a Shiva Linga with a Nandi. The temple was built in a Panchayatana style, indicating a very early experiment in temple construction. The special feature of this temple is that it starts with a rectangular structure and ends with a square structure. Based on a wooden construction design, the square and rectangular plan has a steep roof, which is an adaptation of wooden styles in stone.

The maha mandapa is open to exterior by large windows between the pillars. The roof above the maha mandapa shows a turret as a first version of the future forms of tower: shikharas in north India and vimanas in the south",13,13,,0,,,12,,0,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOgNhXud1VZSN0kJi4lQVuTXODO7SaT6EZqBJKT=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,,8,0,0,,a month ago,,,Karnataka,8,13

In the same complex a beautiful goddess Saraswati temple is in south with exquisite stone columns. Just by side another temple where three Devee,s  Saraswati, Gayatri and  Sharada idols can be seen.

They have parking available and buggy service available too, buggy is 20rs per head for two way and it will take you near to the main temple. It is fair way for the price.

Entrance ticket is 40rs which can be used for lotus mahal as well. We have purchased our ticked at lotus mahal which have been used for entrance here.

Main attraction was the stone chariot & musical pillars.

The ruins are beautiful architectures , few spots definitely needs restoration in order to save our ancient history.

Founded in 1955 by Lieutenant General S.M. Shrinagesh, General Officer, and Commander-in-Chief Southern Command, the temple is situated in the heart of a lush green park. In addition to that, there is also a play area for the kids.

The foundation stone of Military Mahadev Temple was laid on January 18, 1954. The temple was opened to public on January 24, 1955 by Lieutenant General S.M. Shrinagesh, General Officer and Commander-in-Chief Southern Command.

Military Mahadev Temple has undergone several renovations and modifications through the years and the dome has been completely changed. There is a religious ritual practised every Monday called Samuhik Panchamrit, also called as the collective offering of the Panchamrit. This Panchamrit is made of four important elements - honey, yogurt, ghee, and sugar. The most important festival celebrated here is Mahashivratri. It has undergone renovations with a new dome built in the original style and carvings similar to those in other South Indian temples.

This statue of Lord Ganesha is around 8 feet tall and is kept in an open pavilion. It is said that the stomach of the deity resembles the shape of a mustard seed and hence the name as ‘sasivekalu’ means mustard seed in Kannada.

Don't forget to book the trek online,

Don't litter the place nor play loud music.

Situated on the banks of the Tungabadra River, this temple was built by the Hoysala Empire's General Polalva during the reign of King Vira Narasimha II and it truly showcases the remarkable architectural skills of the ancient Hindus.

As soon as I entered the temple grounds, I felt a sense of peace and positive energy. The monolithic architecture of the temple was truly awe-inspiring and I was amazed by the intricate carvings and details on the walls and pillars.

I highly recommend visiting this temple to anyone interested in Hindu culture and history. It's a truly unique and special place that will leave you feeling rejuvenated and inspired. Do make sure to take the time to explore the surroundings and appreciate the beauty of the Tungabadra River.

All of them are interconnected with each other. There is entry fee of Rs.40 per Indian adult. Inside this complex there are plenty of historical monuments.

The whole building looks symmetric with respect to this central hall. The tower of the central hall resembles (though mostly destroyed) more like that of temples. However the five pairs of domes on either side are of Islamic in style. They are better preserved and of alternating patterns. Metal hooks (used to tie the elephants) on the inside roof can be seen. At the rear of each hall are small manhole type openings for the mahouts to enter the elephant compartments. It's one of the UNESCO World Heritage Site

Truly a great place to find the winged beauties.

The park provides the necessary freedom for the beautiful creatures. They can be found freely flattering around with their colourful wings. It is a natural habitat which provides conducive conditions so that the butterflies of various kinds are attracted to the park.

While strolling around the park we can distinctly see butterflies lay eggs, eggs there hatching into caterpillars, the caterpillars turn into pupa and also a beautiful butterfly emerge from a pupa.

The park is a home for some of the rare species like the Blue Nawab, Southern Birdwing which is the largest butterfly found in India and is endemic to south India. The Malabar Banded Peacock, considered as India’s 3rd beautiful butterfly and also an endemic to South India can be found here.

As a photography lover I really loved this place a lot. A great experience and a memorable one. Its worth the visit.",,,,,,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOupbggrmLQcT8OB_V5EwqwB8pRguLA2yGWjfo_=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,,,,,,a month ago,,,Karnataka,,

The dam in surrounded by hills and looks amazing. It is approximately 2 hours from Bangalore city.On the way there is a small ghat in chikballapur which is good. From the highway you need take a village route which is a little bumpy and off road. Other than that there is no hassle for both bikes and cars. Parking is sufficient. The dam as of now is pretty clean and not sure for long it will be clean because of tourist's littering. You can plan and get your swimwear as well. Ofcourse be mindful and take precautions before swimming into deep areas in the dam. Best time to visit would be early mornings or evenings. It's a good getaway for a day. There are also other nearby spots which can be visited in a day. Overall it's a very nice place to visit I would rate it 9/10.,1,3,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPd8qYOeH43uv1wEu4KQyRtSNDFOnIo4ZR5aTs=w1920-h1080-k-no,,plastic,1,,3,,1,5,2,Visit Dandiganahalli Dam on your trip to Bengaluru or India,,,16,,1,14,17,ground clearance,,,,10,9,,Wednesday,0,14,12,11,4.2,Thursday,,0,,12,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMz0aFrSYax8GY-I87cP_s2ol_3SEr5hcv1wbP3=w150-h150-k-no-p,16,10,10,,Monday,7,,,9,,,37,,,4.4,,2,59,1,6,14,,3,1,,16,32,1,1,"GM55+M7F, Dandiganahalli, Karnataka 561211, India",1,14034,23,19,False,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMySzefi4F1cDFlFBZPVZea5i-7Ya-npoUUDsK1=w1920-h1080-k-no,8,1,6,Gudibande Fort,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO9EyYl4ncHrPr7MpAbNF6O0-6tGHm3x9xRdTlt=w1920-h1080-k-no,12,1,2023-03-16T07:34:55.222Z,16,,ದಂಡಿಗನಹಳ್ಳಿ ಅಣೆಕಟ್ಟು,9,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Dandiganahalli+Dam/@13.5091762,77.6581726,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x3bb1eeabed94e8b7:0x57dc224e8eabe9e0!8m2!3d13.5091762!4d77.6581726!16s%2Fg%2F1ptzds481?hl=en",19,15,,17,1,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOa7JEmsAJVJo0avOCFA_M85168pv9t8e9LFpXz=w1920-h1080-k-no,,13,21,,1,7,1,19,ChIJt-iU7avusTsR4Omrjk4i3Fc,22,10 months ago,Maniee Mj,5,2022-07-03T13:44:52.303Z,5,1,People also search for,18,,1,17,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOGvIGJGAmkXndirvEzxvxosqT5JMKoWrn_LLeE=w1920-h1080-k-no,,5,7,,0,32,5,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106172753774800326410?hl=en-US,7,,1,Nandi water falls,4,12,,,5,1,,1,14,True,21,2,,,False,66,Tourist attraction,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMVhbmgbKhlJRZh75H8cngyoUG7ou_eRHVhW4Vj=w1920-h1080-k-no,2,,Open 24 hours,4,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOwdyk0IgSvZWzWQbw350HOCWP4rGvDqrUQtmA1=w1920-h1080-k-no,23,,4,"This is so beautiful and very peaceful.

Vajra poha name it's self says it's a Diamond 💎 Falling like a beaten rice.

Very less known and hardly visited by anyone can only accessible only from the month of November to may.

Without forest department permission it's impossible to visit this place 🙌

Note: ( There is no guarantee that the person who goes will comes back safely)

So think twice and decide whether to visit or not.

This falls is located in the core region of Bhemghad tiger reserve.

That's the main reason why this place is restricted and not allowed for public.

As per my personal experience this place and the falls is not so easy as it looks in the pictures or videos.

One life,one precious life so don't take blind risk.

If u get permission from the department visit madi along with the forest officials or with the guard.

It's 6km Trek up and down  and it's takes three hours to reach the falls one side and three hours to return and u need to cross rivers twice to thrice.

Don't waste time near the waterfalls just return back before the dark.

I never recommend anyone to visit this place it's your own risk if anything happens no one is responsible.

Note: Be a responsible traveller/ Tourist whatever you bring just carry them back aste 🤟",,,,,,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO-7NDcf5s1b7E5P3YQ8kIpTeJ66AWqcTE-8ple=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,,,,,,a month ago,,,Karnataka,,

It was so serene and peaceful ✌️ 😌

I just took a walk across the beach and collected all the conch and corals , it was amazing experience.

There was also a shiva temple on the sea shore and it was worth visiting.

Plenty of parking available for cars and its 2km from NH 66 highway.",11,4,Other,1,1,1,10,2,0,1,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMXhwm7Ci-mkvJKgv3wjwpSTGms3OZWHDgDHosC=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,,6,1,2,,a month ago,,1,Karnataka,6,4

The major portion was leased by the #TourismDept and given away for running some resort  (God only knows who goes there) and no action was  taken when a Tunnel find was reported in #TimesofIndia dt.21Apr2012 and a #Canon find was again reported on 3Mar2016.

Taken over by the Maratha King Chatrapathi Shivaji in 1655, it was
ReConstructed by Sonde SadashivNayaka aka  SadashivLingaRaja  and his son BasavaLingaRaja in 1698, who named it after his father Raja of Sonda King Sadashiva Nayaka as Fort Sadashivagada.

A visit to Hampi is a must for anyone interested in the rich Indian cultural heritage and that grandeur of the Vijayanagara Empire.

The amount of time needed to have a full appreciation of Hampi depends on your interests and the pace of your visit since Hampi is a vast area and monuments and ruins are widely scattered across the World Heritage Area.

We spent six days in Hampi during mid January. If you are interested in exploring all of the major monuments in Hampi, it is recommended that you spend at least 3 days.

Don’t miss to see the sunrise from the top of Mathanga Hill and sunset from Anjanadri Temple.

It's about 3 hours away from Hyderabad and a day trip from there is ideal.

The fort complex is quite large, however the areas one can visit aren't as expansive. The complex also houses a museum and a cafeteria. The cafeteria was closed during our visit, however. The complex also houses neat restrooms.

Car parking is available, although it isn't very large. Having said that, it's sufficient for the crowds it draws at the moment.

There is no entry fee currently. Visitors are allowed inside the premises during visiting hours. We heard from friends that the fort complex is shut on Fridays, so plan accordingly.

Bidar also houses the Bahmani tombs and the Ashtoor tombs. They are a 10 minute drive from Bidar Fort. One must definitely visit the tombs as well

The last two kms of the drive is a complete off-road . Only accessible by own transport. No other way to reach .
The entrance fee is ₹50 per adult and the parking charges for a car is ₹50. There are washrooms which are not maintained well.

There are about 100 stairs to descend to view the syntheri rocks. Half of the stairs are extremely steep. There are enough benches provided for resting. Plz note that , the shop over here does not sell cool drinks or water. Hence it is better to carry the same on your own.

Jan to March is the best time if you want to see nesting behaviour of Spot-billed Pelicans, Spoonbills, Painted Storks, various heron and egret species, Little and Indians cormorants, Stone Curlews or Thick-knees, and River Terns. There are several other species as well, though they are a bit difficult to spot on the walking trails. There are 2-3 bird watching towers for photography and birding.

There is also a well created but small information centre that's interactive and engaging.

Boating is available for large groups and small - you can hire a special boat for your group at 2000rs. The boatmen help you identify the birds as well. Marsh crocodiles resting on rocks is a grand sight too.

There is a long walking/hiking trail, children's play areas, a food court+canteen serving simple fare, a sweet corn booth, and a sugarcane stall. Toilets are clean and there's a baby care room as well. Pets are not allowed.

Entry tickets cost Rs.75 per adult, plus camera fees up to Rs.600 if you are carrying a DSLR.",,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP4PWxGXOAmzj9XUwYx6G1TB2fz8eYDm69iwyi8=w1920-h1080-k-no,,boat ride,,,0,,,0,0,Ranganathittu Bird Sanctuary - Mandya - Karnataka Tourism,,,19,,4,16,71,foreigners,True,,,35,19,,Wednesday,,,,0,4.5,Thursday,,0,,14,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN1282b2EkpDDWsewFwZ5vnYF5UkcrDTqZBBzEt=w150-h150-k-no-p,18,12,12,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMVw6We2_1bvqxop1yGC1e_gNSo-H5-rKNA4Qo=w150-h150-k-no-p,Monday,9,,,11,,,71,True,,4.3,,,1140,8,8,16,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOkcdm_-YD7xAoBIr_tXAufbxHf9TwlqMGBaC0=w150-h150-k-no-p,0,,,18,68,0,,"Ranganathittu Rd, Srirangapatna, Karnataka 571438, India",,97582,30,15,False,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO2C_qgynsjH0B2KbL4XUgH0rYlZOGpbLiMv7dl=w1920-h1080-k-no,10,19,8,Bird Viewing Point Ranganathittu,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPXFZN_gITjqLYTGe8cMIhpMk27XrpWcsX2_3NH=w1920-h1080-k-no,11,0,2023-03-16T07:53:23.383Z,18,,ರಂಗನತಿಟ್ಟು ಪಕ್ಷಿಧಾಮ,11,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ranganatittu+Bird+Sanctuary/@12.4243603,76.6563492,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x3baf7777dd032e0b:0xdfd27aad93e2bc43!8m2!3d12.4243603!4d76.6563492!16zL20vMDhfbXoz?hl=en",21,17,,19,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPm-VdRcP2vouV4xnmxtQD41_FlHF5xdoZ8ZmAV=w1920-h1080-k-no,,15,23,,0,28,1,21,ChIJCy4D3Xd3rzsRQ7zik6160t8,,a month ago,puneet goyal,21,2023-02-13T05:48:17.495Z,5,0,People also search for,20,,26,19,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPPtKobTF-e3NSB9n2UwITLQsHiZ9y5GbagZEq4=w1920-h1080-k-no,,0,9,,,0,7,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116225630623299667739?hl=en-US,24,,,Sri Ranganaathaswaami Temple (Pancharanga Kshetra),29,14,,,7,0,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOGo3VtshUDeAyrB_tEKB4B4rkQW6i4v6QmyPc=w150-h150-k-no-p,0,16,True,23,,1,,False,1421,Tourist attraction,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO-3XFbXk7eyH1PkhDBy_8OyBJtPTNgNAiYr_aw=w1920-h1080-k-no,23,,8:30 AM to 5:30 PM,6,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOVrmzbziqCvJdPzbItb6ouPHDrJSiCyIYunQwf=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,6,A wonderful place to spend sometime with family / friends.

The surroundings are so picturesque. Despite the damage done, it still stands and wow's the visitors.
Take your time in going around the monuments and, if possible, hire a guide who can tell you details of the place and its historical significance.
Try not to carry any bags while you trek up as the monkeys are very active and could try to snatch. They are in plenty here, so be on the lookout. They never troubled us as we just had our phones in our hands for pictures.

This waterfall keeps up with the saying ""Difficult roads often lead to beautiful destinations. "" But here it would be BAD ROADS instead of DIFFICULT.
Roads are in very bad condition and it's very sad to see such beautiful destinations are still underdeveloped.
One needs to pay the entrance plus parking fees and then a short walk of 5min to see the water falls.
You can take a risk climbing/ sliding through the rocks to get a closer view of the falls which I would not recommend as the water flow might increase anytime depending upon the rainfall in the upper catchment area of the waterfalls. There are incidents where people get stuck on either side of the falls and forest guards spend hours together to bring them back safely.
Also the place has been neatly maintained and it's good to see such a beautiful destination very clean .
Get your own food / water / snacks / medicine or any stuff that you might need as the distance to the main town is around 25kms and it takes close to an hour or more to reach back considering the bad condition roads.",,,,,,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP006NRY1z6BVC7g2sNJVjkFZENTcBqTuiHVoes=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO3ix_tS9UF1_ENNalYBsOyAB-XDsmxmhgwtI8=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,5 months ago,,,Karnataka,,

He pulled me downstairs for taking a selfie of myself and said to give 300₹ for taking pic. He could have politely said not to make more pics but instead he created a scene and pulled me down. The people sitting at ticket counter are part of this dirty money making business just for photo they charge extra 300₹. And the entry ticket(₹240) itself is not worth it. It only took 15-25mins to visit whole Palace. Its very small place and very modern architecture, and crockery inside. Not very historical visit and then too he created a scene. It's just a place for business, not a tourist attraction. People living in banglore don't even bother to visit here.

The ticket cost 240 rupees each and if you are using mobile camera additional 300rs has to be paid.

The place is well maintained and there is enough parking space.
Most important thing carry your any of the identity proof with you because if you don’t have they will take 2000 Rs./- as a refundable deposit and at the end they will refund you. This is require for audio guide.

There is a audio guide available(mobile phone and a earphone supplied) which can be played at marked spots to understand the significance of that spot.
There people are supportive they told as I don’t carry as Identity proof and also I don’t have cash with me.
So, I have given online to them and after that they provide me cash for that audio guide .
Very helpful people are there .
The palace has many beautiful and vivid locations for capturing.
Overall the ticket price is really high it can be reduced a bit otherwise its a beautiful place to spend a day.
Try to visit on weekdays because weekends are crowded
