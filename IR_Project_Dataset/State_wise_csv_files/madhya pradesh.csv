Without tips they will just take rounds and rounds but not show anything. And also some guides do not respect women for example Samar Singh Rajpoot. They even don't have proper IDs.

What's sets it apart from the famed Madhai sanctuary is the entry point. You have to enter from Bhaura on Itarsi - Betul highway. The entry gate is at Dhapada village . Some 10kms from Bhaura. Some good luxury resorts  have come up near gate . Entry is allowed from morning to 4 PM. Post that it's not allowed. Forest department charges Rs 3000 per vehicles for entry.
The best part is that you have to drive full 32 Kms in forest to reach camp site at core forest entry. This 32 Kms drive puts up surprises of wildlife. High ground Clearance vehicles are recommended though. But skillful hands can do with ordinary hatchbacks too.
Once at churna camp you can find rooms and facilities like a basic forest department rest house. It does the job efficiently. Just don't expect anything more. Even chilled water is not available. Electricity is there but limited upto lighting purposes. Mobile signals,No. A Typical point at the churna forest camp has some signals if you are lucky to find it.
Gypsy forest Safari e is available from churna base camp to core forest area for rupees 1700. But you have to do it on the very same day you have entered and reached the base if you stay and do the Gypsy Safari the next day you have to pay additional 1500.This part of pachmarhi biosphere has the highest possibility of spotting big cat family.  Spotting bison , blackbuck, spotted deer, wild boar, giant vultures is very easy .

Update- Now you have to take the gypsy compulsorily to Churna site at 32 kms. Your vehicle is not allowed and you have to leave your car at Gate. If you are staying at Churna camp , you can take your car. Even then you have to pay the gypsy charges of Rs 6600.

Still this is probably the only tiger sanctuary which allows to drive your vehicle inside which is a damn satisfying factor as per me.

Wildlife again is abundant and spotting tiger is rather easy due to small area and High concentration of big cat population.",,,,,,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNLWVWB8K65jAsOL1uBiTucc7H-qvqnwK5TQIO7=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,,,,,,8 months ago,,,Madhya Pradesh,,

Enjoyed, but it was one of the toughest day of my life because of so much hassle and crowd there. You can clearly see the distance from where the photograph has been taken. So my ride started at 5 pm today after just leaving from the society when I got to mainroad there was some tableu coming which almost destroyed the traffic, after overcoming from that traffic I continued my journey. After some distance I gone to a wrong gali which took a lot time of mine to get on the right track. There was such traffic I just can't explain to you. When I reached there I got to know that there is no official parking space so people were parking their vechiles anywhere. But I was on a cycle so I was able to take my cycle through the crowd till the very last point of entrance so that it will be safe. Afterwards I was thinking that what should I do to make sure that it will not get theft, so I repeated the same technique I did 1 year ago when I came to this place first time by cycle, I purchased something like flowers and all the other Pooja items and requested the shopkeeper to take care of my cycle till I arrive. After that I gone to the temple premises there was such a crowd that it took me 1/2 hour to reach inside. It was very tough for a introvert boy like me to go in such a crowded place, I was making sure that I should not get fall on anybody because it was such level crowded. There was not a showcase at the entry point and there was this announcement was happening stating that Go inside the temple wearing shoes. I know its not right because that is a place of worship but there was not an option. I performed all the Pooja that was known to me and afterwards started to get out from there and get to a open place to take a picture and get some fresh air. After reaching at a place on the exit I clicked this picture and get back to shop where I kept my cycle and said thanks to them and departed from there. Also a little accident happened with me when I was coming back a Girl crashed her scooty with my rear tyre. It was not such big accident but she immediately apologized for that so I didn't said anything except no worries to her. Afterwards I reached home after such a hassle and now I'm going to my society's Mahashivratri Function to enjoy the eve. Hoping that someone would read this so so long review and if anyone has read it please give this review a like to let me know. Thanks 👍🏻!",18,,,Saturday,16,11,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOxIh2Cxm22UEWFeYcGTXmlX6ZWmQsz9HXf-sSg=w150-h150-k-no-p,"E 19, Kachnar City Rd",https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM5cTxBjOK_Ioy4Aag2VGKmSdMFgiGPx1VNJJ_H=w150-h150-k-no-p,True,19,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113563401322433809339,22,A very beautiful and divine place in the city of jabalpur at kachnar city.

Baz Bahadur’s Mahal was built in 1508 by Nasir-ud-Din, the Sultan of Malwa.

Baz Bahadur became fond of this palace because of his eternal romance with the singer Roopmati who used to visit the nearby Rewa Kund.

It's a giant temple of Lord Shiv in Ling-form, visited by thousands of devotees daily, situated on the banks of Narmada River.

From the pictures, it might have a strong resemblance to Rishikesh.

The temple is multi-storeyed, so for elderly people it might be tricky to climb all the stairs.

There is a small parking space, and you will find autorickshaws and totos (e-rickshaws) constantly going to and from the omkareshward Jyotirling. It's hardly 5 min from the Omkareshwar bus stand and there are buses from Indore (2-2.5 hours) /Ujjain (3.5-4 hours) going daily (check out online and prefer online booking else you might have to wait till the next bus arrives)

There is no entrance fees but if you wish not to stand in queue for 3-4 hours, I would recommend if possible get a VVIP ticket (costs 1100 for 2) or at least VIP ticket - there are no counters but you might come across multiple pundits at the entrance of the bridge that takes you to the temple. Do check on the Arti timings, as during then devotees aren't allowed to go inside the premises.

It is aprox. 10km from pachmarhi busstand. It is very near to Badamahadev temple, just walkable distance.
Entrance one big statue of Anjaneya is there. And the cave is very narrow and going through that cave is little bit adventurous. Cave is 30-40feet long. Inside the cave Shivalnga and Ganesha idols are there.
Since the cave is very narrow, only max of 8peoples can accomodate at a time.

The Kandariya Mahadeva temple was built during the reign of Vidyadhara (r. c. 1003-1035 CE). At various periods of the reign of this dynasty many famous temples dedicated to Vishnu, Shiva, Surya, Shakti of the Hindu religion and also for the Thirthankaras of Jain religion were built. This is without any doubt the largest and most magnificent temple in Khajuraho. The elegant proportions of this building and its sculptural detailing are the most refined examples of this artistic heritage of central India.

Kandariya Mahadev shares its high platform with the small Mahadev shrine and the medium - sized Devi The Kandariya Mahadeva Temple, 31 metres (102 ft) in height, is in the western complex, which is the largest among the three groups of the Khajuraho complex of temples. This western group of temples, consisting of the Kandariya, Matangeshwara and Vishvanatha temples, is compared to a ""cosmic design of a hexagon (a yantra or Cosmo gram)"" representing the three forms of Shiva. The temple architecture is an assemblage of porches and towers which terminates in a shikhara or spire, a feature which was common from the 10th century onwards in the temples of Central India.

The temple is founded on a massive plinth of 4 meters (13 ft) height. The temple structure above the plinth is dexterously planned and pleasingly detailed. The superstructure is built in a steep mountain shape or form, symbolic of Mount Meru which is said to be the mythical source of creation of the world. The superstructure has richly decorated roofs which rise in a grand form terminating in the shikara, which has 84 miniature spires. The temple is in layout of 6 square kilometers (2.3 sq. mi), of which 22 are extant including the Kaṇḍāriyā Mahādeva Temple. This temple is characteristically built over a plan of 31 meters (102 ft) in length and 20 metres (66 ft) in width with the main tower soaring to a height of 31 meters (102 ft), and is called the ""largest and grandest temple of Khajuraho"". A series of steep steps with high rise lead from the ground level to the entrance to the temple. The layout of the temple is a five-part design, a commonality with the Lakshmana and Vishvanatha temples in the Khajuraho complex. Right at the entrance there is torana, a very intricately carved garland which is sculpted from a single stone; such entrances are part of a Hindu wedding procession. The carvings on the entrance gate shows the ""tactile quality of the stone and also the character of the symmetrical design"" that is on view in the entire temple which has high relief carvings of the figurines. Finely chiseled, the decorative quality of the ornamentation with the sharp inscribed lines has ""strong angular forms and brilliant dark-light patterns"". The carvings are of circles, undulations giving off spirals or sprays, geometric patterns, masks of lions and other uniform designs which has created a pleasant picture that is unique to this temple, among all others in the complex.",17,,,Saturday,7,71,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN1ktb7O9X7eKJ8xUlhvzzwREWSZuz0r5X6uOv8=w150-h150-k-no-p,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMozrDsxOLan-knkEX0msFgO7rmnVTKKUVN7WEv=w150-h150-k-no-p,True,18,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108236682443199699711,21,"Absolutely magnificent and stunning architecture by mighty Chandela king, Vidhyadhar.

Wonderfully maintained national park, this is supposed to be India's smallest national park which really feels like a zoo rather than a national park I'd say. I'd highly recommend coming here on some evening during the time of sunset by hiring a bicycle. It's an extremely relaxing and soothing drive all the way till the very end where there's an extremely pretty bird sanctuary. Having a DSLR with you will definitely help you get some extremely pretty shots of the sunset overlooking the Upper Lake area with beautiful birds all around. There's also a mini snake park and a butterfly park inside. There are multiple nodes of transport you can use here but nothing beats the feeling you get riding a bicycle through the entire stretch. Probably my favourite place in all of Bhopal, I loved it so much that I came here 3 times in my total 5 day trip. The best part is that the Upper Lake boating area is also extremely close-by, almost walkable so you can finish your Van vihar cycling and go for boating there which makes a perfect evening in Bhopal.",,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOHW3NYwXUDSZVN4DymY1AlVIB0okuqc7QhRIkR=w1920-h1080-k-no,orphaned,,,17,,0,,"Van Vihar National Park | District Bhopal, Government ... - भोपाल",,23,11,3,15,25,in situ,,,,14,20,,Wednesday,,,,0,4.3,Thursday,0,,13,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPgTG3krzG6wWtz2Fi9W_CPFNjKdX8wY6jWoarT=w150-h150-k-no-p,17,11,11,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM0qf6hZdUozvzE8PVqKuStcrlrdooXCyHnvOoy=w150-h150-k-no-p,Monday,8,,10,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO8ug0DFtH-nXI69AP-hAGN9PGv7heO1GQemDZU=w150-h150-k-no-p,,20,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM5uzV2WEsCQv6mZLsEnJbib6_dkNR7W44muDPh=w150-h150-k-no-p,4.3,,144,3,7,15,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM4wZSMiJ3JUG1PvZxJAlpJSb8MTPnuCfKEQSmN=w150-h150-k-no-p,12,,,32,0,,"69J8+VHM, Lake View Walk Path, Krishna Nagar, Shymala Hills, Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh 462002, India",,60027,16,9,False,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNplY6eUALuj3Ad8ht0Px5ZZFnAUFlHEE6l6hZ-=w1920-h1080-k-no,9,,7,वन विहार भोपाल मध्यप्रदेश भारत,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMvDvCu-vzXHZVhLgM6seSDocvZyGxt1AkpN9RE=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNKHw9TK_38h294y5jyhivPSbiJtsYfS6Nc862Q=w1920-h1080-k-no,20,0,2023-03-17T13:43:15.041Z,17,,व्हान विहार नॅशनल पार्क भोपाळ,10,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Van+Vihar+National+Park+Bhopal/@23.232214,77.3664318,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x397c5d4884b722b5:0xa5feafcbfd12da6!8m2!3d23.232214!4d77.3664318!16zL20vMDhfcnhw?hl=en",,16,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPWqfrbI2XJafiw3fC1wAxfLgypqn97YAnGdY1m=w150-h150-k-no-p,18,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMLtM-KxzGlbLmrWQxWnXh9D-3Owu5VWm-jaC0g=w1920-h1080-k-no,,14,,,,0,9,3,20,ChIJtSK3hEhdfDkRpi3Rv_zqXwo,,3 months ago,Allen Kuki,4,2022-12-25T12:55:53.576Z,5,0,People also search for,19,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPPy38bYosyXMgCV_crTHwwVylaKYH35wrLkJ7_=w150-h150-k-no-p,,18,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM9DTdFZRYQtWtcDoz5EWvvMl2yHF6wE568WqLV=w1920-h1080-k-no,,20,8,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNPilysn4yZFkzXGxiCrudKxTvOK-wSkEuKrE9O=w150-h150-k-no-p,,26,6,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112988035996001617182?hl=en-US,6,,,White Tiger,20,13,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPZmmz5MbeOlFNOlZFvsHNHGqWOQgG16sEmecHa=w150-h150-k-no-p,6,,0,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMcKukcHrudFQRvkP55yljvcvWoG5gd_9Psmg8L=w150-h150-k-no-p,0,15,True,22,,5,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMkQVf2ePa2iKes2tQSJ_F-X3yQ-rgJ764lBXsl=w150-h150-k-no-p,False,152,Tourist attraction,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPJ64TuP0WtJgcho1vHt1yoHuW41AzBg22P5bfb=w1920-h1080-k-no,3,,6:30 AM to 6:30 PM,5,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN7QYWtsLjLsAhyzNiiaT5ZyvVX4h_Lib68sCtI=w1920-h1080-k-no,True,,,5,"Wow it's was an amazing to see all wild animals like tigers, bear 🐻, Deer 🦌, Crocodile 🐊, Birds.

Earlier it was known as Forsyth Point.

It was in the year 1857 that Captain Forsythe discovered Pachmarhi from this place. After its discovery, the British people developed Pachmarhi as a hill station. It paved the way for the existing development of Pachmarhi.

In the post-colonial period, it was named Priyadarshini Point.

From here, you can have a beautiful view of the entire Pachmarhi valley, especially the Handi Khoh.

Kuno National Park, is like an ornament in the Vindhyan Hills of Central India. It is a rare jungle, an oasis nestled between an otherwise rocky and unforgiving landscape. The stories and the legends from the land of Kuno, are as old as time itself and the denizens of this land can narrate endless tales of sacrifice and longing. The place is full of ancient forts and structures which have now been reclaimed by the forest, lush green vegetation dominated by the “Kardhai”, “Khair” and “Salai” trees, an amazing world having rich diversity and very high density of winged creatures, freely roaming ungulates and carnivores and in the midst of all this flows the famous Kuno river, from which this park derives its name; which is the silent spectator to the national park’s rich history and testimony to its revitalization, re-emergence and revival from the verge of being completely wiped out to what it is today.",,,,,,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPExXNL3orjIZWr5Lu-nGfi6yMV_aSd73_8VxWD=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN2zCB8QdOTsYgDqBYWZqDb9jbpY9WrufedJ2Dq=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,3 weeks ago,,,Madhya Pradesh,,

Hindola Mahal Built by Hushang Shah, probably around A.D. 1425 as a Durbar hall.
The walls are inordinately thick and slope like those of a castle. The slope of over 77 degrees gives a swinging appearance to the building, hence the name.
The plan is 'T' shaped. The upright stem being the main hall (which was built first), and the cross bar is a transverse portion added later.
The structure was probably supposed to have the zenana place as another storey above the main hall, which would explain the bulk and strength of the walls.

Capt. James Forsyth discovered Pachmarhi in 1857. That was also the time when he located five caves on a hill. In the local language, five means ‘Pach; and a cave means ‘Marhi’. So the town came to be known as Pachmarhi. Later Britishers developed the town as the only hill station in central India, for their stay during hot Indian summers.
Pandav Caves is a very popular tourist attraction in Pachmarhi. It is a hill feature about 150 to 200 feet high, where around six room-shaped caves have been carved out of solid rock. As per the local folklore/legends, these caves are the ones where the Pandavas had spent time during their exile Five caves were for five brothers and the sixth cave was for Draupadi. Wife of Pandavas. A comparatively bigger and best-ventilated cave which also has beautiful carvings on the wall was occupied by Draupadi. The darkest cave was occupied by Bhima the toughest of them all.
As per another and more credible version, these caves were carved out of solid rock by Buddhist monks around the 10th – 11th century for their stay and meditation. This version acquires more credibility as a remain of a brick-made stupa on top of the hill can still be seen.
Parking is not too far from the Pandav caves. The road from the parking to the garden at the base of the hill is lined on both sides by the usual street food, soft drink, tea coffee vendors and shops selling toys for kids and other small knickknacks.
At the end of the street, we entered a beautifully laid-out and maintained garden. The full beauty can really be seen and appreciated only when viewed from the top of the hill.
The path from the garden exits in an open space from where steps with safety railings have been made to facilitate climbing the hill which lead to Pandav Caves. One can make out that originally the steps were carved out from solid rock. Administration replaces all the damaged/worn out and unsafe steps with proper concrete steps. Steps and the railing make the climb quite comfortable and tourist-friendly.",13,25,Recreations,0,,,12,,0,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMeBgDg93gw7eK-VeucwdDR0O43JOSgCsZhG9VO=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,,8,0,0,,a month ago,,,Madhya Pradesh,8,18

One of the best I've had in India. Lover the way in which it has been curated, walking through the main exhibit allows us to get a glimpse into the everyday life of the tribal people and then moves onto their spiritual relation with birth, passage of life and death.

I believe the museum did justice to the diverse culture and shared land of the people depicted here and I greatly appreciate that. There is also a wonderful food zone which has a good variety of foods available, and a wonderful gift galley and paintings shop where we can buy art and books by and on the tribal folks.

I would also like to point at the amount of care and effort put into creating the displays and messing it all together into a cohesive story - greatest admiration to the people behind it. Also, the folks currently running and maintaining the place are doing a fantastic job.

Highly recommend the museum for everyone.

These caves feature statues of Hindu and Jain statues. One Ganesha and one Vishnu rock cut statues which are found here are said to be one of the oldest statues in the world.
This cave also features Varaha Dev protecting mother earth from Rakshasa, Chandragupta 2, Brahma Dev, Shiva and many more rock cuts from that era.

Start exploring from the left side of the caves after entering from the main gate as all the rock cut caves are present there.
From the right side you have to go up the hill through the stairs only to see the view around.
