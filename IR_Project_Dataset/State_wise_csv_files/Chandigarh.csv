यह पूरे चंडीगढ़ शहर का सबसे खूबसूरत पार्क है। विभिन्न प्रकार की प्रतिमाएँ हैं। आम जनता को इसके अंदर जाने की अनुमति नहीं है। इस पार्क में तीन साइड सड़कें हैं। जहां से यह खूबसूरत दिखता है पार्क की जितनी तारीफ की जाए उतनी कम है। हर कोई जो चंडीगढ़ आता है, वे इस पार्क को देखेंगे। #पार्क 🌳🧒🚶👮🏃🏃🏃🚣

This is the most beautiful park in the entire city of Chandigarh. There are different types of statues. The general public is not allowed inside it. This park has three side streets.

For experience, try boating with friends/family. Shikara ride for couples and it's a great first date activity.

Food options are also quite good. From South Indian, to Chinese and kulcha + bhelpuri vendors for street food experience.

For Kids; some rides and activities within the premises. The camel ride is also there outside the lake.

Sketch Artists are also present nearby food arena.

Birds, Nature is awesome.

Overall, it's a must visit whenever you are in Chandigarh.

The entry ticket for adults is 100rs  and for kids 50rs. The best experience is lion safari which is for 15 minutes at price of 75rs. The zoo is well maintained. Many wild animals can be found in the area. There are many water and bird species. Dinosaur park is good which contains models of different dinosaurs which move a little bit. There is a separate place for big birds which is quite amazing as birds are free to move in that particular area. Reptile house is good but there are less species. There is canteen at every 5 minute’s walking. Overall a great place to spend a day with kids and it will usually take you 3-5 hours easily.","(Translated by Google) What zoo is under construction

Churches are an important part of many communities, providing a place for people to gather and deepen their faith. They offer a supportive and inclusive environment where people can come together to pray, worship, and learn about their religion. Churches also provide valuable social services and outreach programs, helping to serve the needs of their communities. For many people, churches serve as a source of comfort, hope, and inspiration, offering guidance and support during life's challenges. The selflessness and dedication of church leaders and members is also commendable, as they work to make a positive impact in the lives of others. Overall, churches play a vital role in shaping and strengthening communities, and are deserving of praise for their contributions.",Can someone please tell the timing of services on Good friday and Easter?,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100638679492878671597?hl=en-US,peaceful,,,,,,,,"https://www.google.com/maps/search/chandigarh+places+to+visit/@30.7349273,76.6199957,12z/data=!4m2!2m1!6e1?hl=en",,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMBfVK1TzEAVD2PMLsNn7G2Eyp1esNXxFcV_MWV=w150-h150-k-no-p,True,,A religious worship place.

As I walked through the garden, I could see that the flowers had been carefully selected and arranged in a way that was both aesthetically pleasing and structurally sound. The gardeners had clearly put a lot of thought and effort into creating this beautiful display.

In addition to the flowers, the garden also had several fountains and water features that added to its charm. The sound of the water added to the peaceful and serene atmosphere of the garden.

The place is wonderfully designed.
There are many things to explore inside, like The Doll museum,  laughing mirrors, a small aquarium, and big swings.

The rock structures are beautifully craved and are a delight to watch.

There are many places to take good pictures.

Be very careful of your head as the gates are very low.

You need atleast 2 hours to explore the place completely.

Great place to bring your family and children for a fun day.

The parking is chargeable.",Can we take our pets inside?,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107548790628166667961?hl=en-US,march,31,0,0,0,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMvl9e0tJOFy_12TfW61Npqhf99uzXR4riRHc0j=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,"https://www.google.com/maps/search/chandigarh+places+to+visit/@30.7349273,76.6199957,12z?hl=en",https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMA73hbPjEXZMlMIXmXUEHvDu4-AtqkBn15YNJE=w150-h150-k-no-p,True,7,43,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO6ZDU_4nogxYDSJhDrYlgStj-q8VhdB6cmxnww=w150-h150-k-no-p,,10,Very nice experience.
