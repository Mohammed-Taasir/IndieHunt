This town has two major rivers- Koshi (Kaushaki) and Suyal (Salmali).

Popular pilgrimage sites like Nanda Devi and Jageshwar attract thousands of devotees each year. Almora is also popular among backpackers as it has hostels and cafes in Kasar Devi, a village near Almora.

Many routes that go deeper into the Himalayas start from Almora, and there is also single day to weekend treks near the town. Almora is also popular for mountain biking, Since it is easy to reach Almora and it is at a relatively low altitude, one does not need too much training to bike here. Many shops and resorts rent bikes by the hour or by the day, and you can also enjoy cycling across the rugged mountain paths",,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP_sLd269M36NtXdah_xJi04g9MVaHBjyoB6PSH=w1920-h1080-k-no,home,,,,,,,,Almora Tourism (2023) - Uttarakhand > Top Places ... - Holidify,,,,,6,,capital,,,,5,,,,,,,,4.1,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipObRwOdzppB7PwTRuK70NwMEnpH72tcIaoR-0VQ=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOVAyP251XJOUK730b1zoRrrqMf1-2Ro5PJWTQt=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,,4.6,,,17,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOSivmEDD5rR5wL_pt8HFLA6HGp_7Sz1vVHM8ZN=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,,"HMW4+PGC, Mall Rd, Paltan Bazar, Dharanaula, Almora, Uttarakhand 263601, India",,1478,,,False,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOBxlc4HwW_9ClM22oABanrEBm5bTxdE0DbyqTt=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,Almora Uttarakhand,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNreupjeE2WKt60SXdJUZC2EF5YGJu5NMMrBiC3=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,2023-03-17T11:40:29.434Z,,,अल्मोड़ा,,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Almora/@29.596807,79.6562531,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x39a0b7d14a12b7df:0x2b8719eee6b2d1e7!8m2!3d29.596807!4d79.6562531!16s%2Fg%2F11hyjtyvtm?hl=en",,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNod7AYj-0lQpJQzvHbUr1lNUuTM8rsXGmQTN-D=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,,5,,,,ChIJ37cSStG3oDkR59Gy5u4Zhys,,a month ago,,,2023-02-15T17:08:20.612Z,5,People also search for,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOlmR6cabcduAwGABKyr6eZerWcvMIVA9XRPNs-=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114859202818966587817?hl=en-US,,,,,,चौघानपाटा अल्मोड़ा,,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMWgO2HCCWcyYTSTRr745-HPDb6kzZzYjtjhJ48=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,True,,,,,False,31,Tourist attraction,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPG7BIoHp5wBPijdARxQl1d5fUTE5DJDuSeGL2p=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMQa7q0gFx_wyOpoHUvWxaLBqEEOYHnl4IUHfuw=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,Almora Uttarakhand is the most beautiful place in India .

Located in Kaladhungi, this property dedicated to and where Jim Corbett lived could do with better and informative staff. The gift shop is small room about 8 x 12 feet not enough for even a few people to enter at the same time.

While there are better maintained buildings, the house where Corbett lived really needs a fresh perspective if it wants to “attract” visitors. The people who go there, basically are drawn by the name of the man who lived there.
Even he struggled with red tape when he tried to gift a property to the Forest department. That’s what his letters on the walls, say.

The two separate shacks are poorly maintained and dimly lit. Apart from the pictures on the walls and some few pots and pans, there’s nothing that would make it appealing to the odd tourist. There’s more on the internet !

The toilets were stinking and dirty - probably had not been cleaned in the long time. The faucets/taps were broken and so were the urinals. The toilet for women had a troop of monkeys playing there with no one to even shut the door in an effort to keep them out.

And oh yes, there is an entry ticket - nominal though it is.",6,13,13,,0,,,12,,0,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOw5xdl8HaiMMkve75KWHAuB_CDYaGh04gKshyL=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,,8,0,0,,5 months ago,,,Uttarakhand,8,35

You can plan for it anyday in week. Whenever you want you can go. It remains open all days . Not only in Dehradun there 14 Feb is decide as polling day. But, as I think, once you get out of main city area then you will not fave any problem from police side during your journey . Temperature of Dehradun is not going to do injustice with you. It should be moderate or you can feel a  little cold weather . But , it will not be that freezing type.

After all, I think you are going with your buddy . If not then I will suggest you to find one to company you. It will not going to be that much enjoyable all alone in deep forest. During your track You will find so many places where you will feel to sit and to feel the vibe, to talk to someone of your heart , you shall find too many selfie/ picture spots where you couldn't resist yourself to do so.

Khalanga war memorial is dedicated to the memory of the Gorkha soldiers who fought the British in 1814 in the battle of Nalapani, the first battle of the Anglo-Nepalese war.

Review:
The road to the top of the hill is in very bad shape. It is very tough to bring the vehicle to the hill-top. Avoid bringing any scooties here as it won't serve you any good.
Good experience in off-road driving can be a great help.

Place: The place is just a small memorial podium with a tall structure erected in the honour of the Gorkha soldiers. It is surrounded with trees and other flora & fauna. One can park their vehicle down, and hike the trail up to the hill top.(roughly 1km)",22,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPRFg_65eSHdh1FIJqi2Pb2RGGQmYcd90zujsYa=w1920-h1080-k-no,bike,,,0,,,0,0,Khalanga War Memorial - Google,,,0,0,14,16,fought,,,,12,31,,Wednesday,,,,0,4.5,Thursday,0,,14,,18,12,12,,Monday,9,11,,,,32,,4.5,,,58,0,8,,16,0,,18,23,0,,,"Raipur, Tibbanala Pani, Uttarakhand 248008, India",,2876,31,0,False,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNvtNm1WpVeSZiuP0rmFbUIeJXmp2LoAddeKQgu=w1920-h1080-k-no,10,8,8,Kalungr (Khalanga) Memorial,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOeZ0lu9PjLpHJtlj-862BWHjV0V8AUCk4JzDFX=w1920-h1080-k-no,0,,0,2023-03-17T11:57:20.991Z,18,,खलंगा युद्ध मेमोरियल (सन 1814 से),11,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Khalanga+War+Memorial/@30.3426432,78.0983735,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x390928050dd88c85:0xdc287b0a911c2331!8m2!3d30.3426432!4d78.0983735!16s%2Fg%2F11c4bj0j9m?hl=en",21,17,,19,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMw9VOwr4TY0GLONV1e8JHoDFx2dJXMBBq-6E50=w1920-h1080-k-no,,15,23,,9,0,21,0,ChIJhYzYDQUoCTkRMSMckQp7KNw,,5 months ago,Shailesh Dixit,16,2023-01-28T17:19:40.109Z,3,,0,20,,26,19,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN58uVqY1NqC5v0KeS7O-lmRpkE_XveOY3NhJY=w1920-h1080-k-no,,0,9,,,0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115753628873621176791?hl=en-US,7,22,,,,Balbhadra Khalanga Dwar Nalapani,29,14,,,7,0,,0,16,True,23,,,,False,62,Tourist attraction,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNrnCFl9D5dolJ3-Gbd5ukBN2P-2bZidZr04ksA=w1920-h1080-k-no,33,,9 AM to 5 PM,6,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOc2pfclafslTJ44k2TcOkNWL7867F_24OTHAUj=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,This place is situated in between beautiful forests.

Peaceful, Divine and Panoramic

It was during the fag end of , I along with my parents, was again on the highway NH-58 heading straight to our hometown situated right in the middle of Devprayag and Pauri Garhwal. It was for performing last of the last rituals of my grandmother’s heavenly abode. We departed from Delhi early in the morning, covering about 300 kms, passing through Mohan Nagar, Muradnagar, Modi Nagar, Purkaji, Roorkee, Haridwar, Rishikesh, Shivpuri, Kaudiyala reaching Devprayag at about 1500 hrs. The hills start soon after crossing Haridwar. Before taking the right turn over the bridge for our 22km onward journey through the state highway, we halted briefly to soak into the divine beauty of the confluence at Devprayag offering our prayers to the almighty and at the same time absorbing the positive energies of the holy place.

Devprayag is a spiritual and godly hamlet situated at the confluence of river Alaknanda and Bhagirathi merging together and forming the river Ganges flowing down about 70kms to Rishikesh. The same highway, on the sides of Devprayag, runs up to Badrinath covering prominent places like Rudraprayag, Karnprayag, Nandprayag, Chamoli, Joshimath. Understandably all the vehicles ferrying pilgrims and travelers alike, pass through divinity of Devprayag on their journey to Badrinath. Seeing two rivers, one can notice that while Alaknanda flows calmly, Bhagirathi runs very rough and when they merge, the sacred gleaming and pristine Ganges emerges out of the confluence of two rivers. Devprayag is prominent for its religious importance among Hindus as the holy Ganges takes its shape and form from this sanctified town. Pilgrims, devotees and travelers alike take holy dips in river Ganges at the confluence. The stream is ferocious so one should be careful while taking dips in the river. They must hold the chains for their safety. At a fair distance from the confluence, many locals from the hill villages also perform cremation and last rites of the departed souls on the river side seeking holy blessing and peace for their heavenly abode. My grandmother’s cremation was also done at the banks of river Ganges emerging out of the confluence, may her soul rest in peace.

Devprayag is equally revered by the tourists for its abundant natural beauty. The place offers tranquility nestled at the base of mountains on all four sides presenting a spectacularly panoramic view in the backdrop of high hills, bustling rivers, temples, devotees, ashrams, riverside resort, bridge and the serpentine roads leading to various destinations. It also houses century old famous Raghunathji temple which is visited by scores of devotee all through the year. The place is easily accessible from Delhi and one can visit Devprayag across all seasons. The winters are tough with river water turning icy cold. During the monsoon, During monsoon, Devprayag’s beauty is seen to be believed. The surroundings turn lush green with river water levels rising up considerably due to heavy rains. At this time, the water running through the river, hitherto, green, clean and pristine turns extremely muddy. Unlike Haridwar and Rishikesh, good that Devprayag is not that crowded.

The birds singing in the background and the leaves rustling in the thing air it seemed like the perfect day to go for a picnic to the springs. I stretched as I got up and felt myself instantly charge up. The amazing excitement ran through our house as we got read in a rush. Enthusiasm rushed through me as I sat in the car.

The hours drive passed in the blink of an eye as we unpacked our car in front of the springs. We had brought soccer balls and a cricket set to play on the grass next the spring that the crystal clear waterfall was gracefully pouring down. In our bathers we decided to have a small dip and go explore up the hill leading to the top of the waterfall.

""The best feeling of my life has arrived!"" my mother warmly said as she dipped her feet in. The splendid beauty touched us gently and we embraced it. Going up the hill we could see the light reflecting off the falling water and creating a rainbow. This sight was spectacular as we slowly went up the hill further. I felt so uplifted as we reached the top of the waterfall. The view of the ocean and the city was in one which was the best sight I had ever seen. A grass patch at the top was the perfect place to play some soccer and, some cricket. The serene feeling of the breeze blowing into my nostrils and the marvellous scent of the flowers. It felt like I was in paradise And I felt like I was on the world's highest podium, above that waterfall, over the world.

Arriving home from what was arguably the best day in the world but I was exhausted. Hungry, I gobbled up my supper and passed out to sleep in a breeze. “What a day!” I thought to myself as my eyelids flickered and closed on the world, only ready to open after a refreshing sleep for the next day",,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMMhoQeQzDVqtgnoM2qvA10tfksaoOCb6l-P-UN=w1920-h1080-k-no,boating,,,,,,,,Popular Picnic Spot in Uttarakhand || Kempty Falls Mussoorie,,,,,6,,car,,,,5,,,Wednesday,,,,,4.4,Thursday,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMfTJBo04V1QiiWCqUSV8AE5N1HIraIfcJ-G5Y7=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,Monday,,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO2k51h0pnNt_r9JZqIni9Sf9QO3G35qssV6_bc=w150-h150-k-no-p,4.3,,,9,,,,,,,,,,,,"F389+54V, Utrakhand, bazar Road, Landour, Mussoorie, Uttarakhand 248179, India",,1983,,,False,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPDhMEZnEhxf2f-c_5Mg7XaVUwBjbG8wc6CxOYX=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,Mossy Falls,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMgwVGJiI5ymzs9eTgDj3iS5lM3MAwpBwIEARFd=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,2023-03-17T11:59:59.511Z,,,मसूरी वॉटरफॉल,,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Mussoorie+Waterfall/@30.4654961,78.0678056,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x3908d0e199822213:0x30aaa768b4127e02!8m2!3d30.4654961!4d78.0678056!16s%2Fg%2F11dynyw18m?hl=en",,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMMOUrrMDsgd9ZHApOZ6fySQFmq48no9_QJnsTh=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMJOBneCGEwisurhgODu_mdtsmMQmA0sSDXj6Yz=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,,5,,,,ChIJEyKCmeHQCDkRAn4StGinqjA,,2 months ago,,,2023-01-22T05:26:14.188Z,5,People also search for,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPmxIpUXdruH-2ez6bjH7ETmvUNcgGXcUt01Zyx=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOTs89PY8G9FUbQdapN0tqxFcs8C_lpMyZCj3TB=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107583692566105136442?hl=en-US,,,,,,Junu Waterfall,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO0uLDmALHxHC4eBJNBVKijx2gyW9PdmdZCIp2E=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,True,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOn95Y04eLQU-PLEyV2VK7Epf2VVjWK2VITqTAU=w150-h150-k-no-p,False,22,Tourist attraction,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipONEQlJdUnZkjWjFTy_ozA3q4Ts12l7nDb9xezL=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,8 AM to 7 PM,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipODt1QdDLO0WkDO0BDWqG89P2A1GISOL_VO1IMS=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,"Nice location beautiful nature👌👌 that good and too much people

Good Place with something for everyone.
I visited Bhatta falls around 5-6 years back and had memories of it from then. But to my amaze things for drastically changed in last couple of years. You can reach there either via ropeway or via your won vehicle but be careful the road is very narrow, steep and have 3-4 hair pin turns. I would suggest the ropeway as it covers entry fees of 50 bucks as well so it would be a reasonable deal. They have made an amusement park sort of thing at Bhatta falls. They have some adventure activities like swings, zip lings and few others. For small kids they have battery operated cars and bikes. To relax they have made small gardens to relax and a restaurant to fill your tummy. However the food quality/taste and the cost are not in sync. I would prefer to void the restaurant. Thye have made a small artificial lake as well with few boats in it. Overall a good place to spend few hours. The good part is that you dont have to plan it during the stay at Mussoorie but you can visit it on your way back from there.",,,,,,,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPNjmKCq4fonaJhF3mCSrLkT0KgC1FdzUszZSJB=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,,,,,,a month ago,,,Uttarakhand,,

Upon arriving at the dam, visitors are greeted by the stunning scenery of the surrounding mountains and forests. The reservoir created by the dam is a vast expanse of blue water that stretches out as far as the eye can see, and the lush green forests provide a peaceful and serene atmosphere.

Enjoy the various water sports available there. You have various options to indulge in activity like speed boat, motor boat, jet ferries, paragliding, water bikes, etc on chargeable basis. The view from top of the theri dam view point is breathtaking.

I would highly recommend a visit to the Tehri Dam. The combination of engineering and nature creates a unique experience that is truly unforgettable.

The waterfall itself was stunning, with crystal clear water cascading down a cliff, surrounded by lush green forests. The view from the top of the waterfall was breathtaking, and I was able to take some amazing photographs of the scenery.

What made the experience even better was the availability of delicious food, including noodles, at the waterfall. The noodles were made fresh and were served hot, and they were the perfect snack to enjoy while taking in the beautiful surroundings. The vendors were friendly and made the whole experience even more enjoyable.

In addition to the stunning waterfall and delicious food, there were also several activities available for visitors to participate in. There was a tracking that crossed the river, which was a fun and unique experience. The area around the waterfall was well maintained, and there were several benches available for visitors to relax and enjoy the view.

Overall, I would highly recommend visiting the water fall in Rishikesh for anyone who loves nature and outdoor activities. The beautiful scenery, delicious food, and fun activities make it an ideal destination for families and friends.

The best part was that we got to visit this at Night, and the experience was altogether different seeing this at Night.

The reservoir in itself is vast and is also used for hydroelectricity generation. However, the sheer force of water that you can experience at the actual control point is terrifying. Though at Night, we got tons of clear pictures of the entire barrage road, and also, though chilly, it was a surreal experience to see the entire reservoir filled to the brim.

Tiger sightings are difficult because the jungle is thick - but population of tigers is very high here as well. We spotted 4 tigers - in an open area of the river bed.

More than anything, it's the cool weather and healthy-happy looking animals that make this place worth visiting. Anyone who has seen the condition of zoo animals in Delhi's peak summer, would understand what I mean. Besides the animals, the views from this place are always magical.

Hope you enjoy a trip to Nainital Zoo through these photos (from early 2000s - 2022). Do feel free to read further while I recount my early days of visiting this zoo.

Still remember my school/college days when we would enter the zoo from the temple side, free of cost :) Back then, there were hardly any regulations, even the fencing was a single net. People would often get too close to the animals. Once held the tail of a Siberian tiger in my hands, while it was being fed through the small food door. Patted a leopard on the back who turned around, growled inches away from my face, as I inhaled it's horribly bad breath! I am glad all that silliness and stupidity is behind me and I am in one piece writing this! The security and safety today is top notch, and as an adult, I discourage any mischievous kids from being reckless, as I once was.",6,13,53,Health & Beauty,0,,,12,,0,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN915RFvVUWSympSYpprMTfIojnybHIP-8ebf1Z=w1920-h1080-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOmTChTCwHwOuuoOl_HBwmq8QwLXXswLmasXcdv=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPmOf0eYAA3YWJkShAtQQ0VDL0_5Rg-UKS7PmfT=w150-h150-k-no-p,8,0,0,,3 months ago,,,Uttarakhand,8,55

The place was nice having small water fall.
The only thing was of attraction is water fall nothing else than that.
Single statue of some tiger's/bhag and one deer.
