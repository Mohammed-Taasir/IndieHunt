This one had a unique collection of historical displays and artifacts from the Indian railway system. The organization and interpretive signs were not always present or clear. The collection could be better organized chronologically and the outdoor collection is a bit cluttered. They did include some good information about the future of the Indian railway system.

If you have kids there is a train ride that provides a quick tour of the outdoor collection. If you're an avid train museum person you'll likely be disappointed by this museum. But for a 1-2 hour visit it's worth it for a few of the unique royal wagons and indoor artifact displays.",10,40,,,,,,9,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM678vPZwgW727JGdHWJTb0_IeIU9WeQ_U_lBZe=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,22,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5Q3sPzPPS0NIF4vOtR0uda0S3MDGsPFAG0zTCzvFA=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4-br100,46,19,16,7,,1.58005E+19,,,0,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPci_jQhs0sWcVJVuOTcjBAcqeO-s13iD_aorc7=w150-h150-k-no-p,,23,12,,,,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoemRldHJnRRAB,Tuesday,,,125745,,16,,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNQDDEpOwDHxX5qKGEBNr21JFVF_NmoK4BvKn8f=w1920-h1080-k-no,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlcVlfY21BRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0xdb46d0593f9caa02!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDeqY_cmAE%7CCgwI4a6hmgYQwITRoAE%7C?hl=en-US,,8,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP_f5JxPr8LdeYojjclsfb6e6uks9Hq6FN50N1v=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5StGoMvUtmFvWNCOPU4acM0DOMwOUWfNH8zLZ62Ag=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3-br100,,7,,,17,,12,2023-03-11T13:24:04.213Z,,,394,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO2IQwInNyLE6yWOipbqAfxem3gdXRETAbmITi5=w150-h150-k-no-p,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP8Gv9vPHhfVIXnjk_j2BVhLtRhgXNQXFLhe2IE=w1920-h1080-k-no,Rail Museum,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNRBgoDzMGTdg-HB2vON9jDS7x4OOrNiGlDNr6U=w150-h150-k-no-p,"This is a must visit place if you are visiting Delhi. It's one of the well maintained and affordable places.
You can buy tickets online for entry ,rides and shows.
It has ample parking space. We visited it on Saturday,when many schools brought kids for museums and train rides. Kids loved their outing followed by lunch time at its garden,basking in the sun .
This place offers train rides - normal train ride,toy train ride and they used to offer steam train rides too(but due to lots of difficulty and risk,they stopped it for the time.)
You can book a guided trip ,which gives you glimpses in old trains,which is closed with normal tickets.
They also provide simulation train experience with different tickets.
You can pick whatever you would like to experience with different ticket options.
The train canteen is also good. We couldn't miss the good aroma of its food and had good lunch. It also has one other vendor offering snacks,tea,coffee and ice cream.
The souvenir shop was also good. We bought some freeze magnets and key chains. You can also buy train models there at affordable prices.",https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMfWIavBDV3jyqonZSBhzvYpGBmmyvGGOlV4jwY=w150-h150-k-no-p,65,22,"National Museum, New Delhi",1.0924E+20,6,,,,27,18,0,7,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNTy694F9PHy21U_Dw2JgiJgDvvCBBIbIP4pyic=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110280450150634177111?hl=en-US,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109083268912894967018,,,"https://www.google.com/maps/search/places+to+visit+in+delhi/@28.5485116,77.2487204,13z/data=!3m1!4b1?hl=en",,,,,Rail museum,,,People also search for,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOhvCF_p0aWtSKrkS4iVQCZibvA9ixivBAKvDnn=w150-h150-k-no-p,0,,0,0,109,1910,,8,,4.5,32,,12,15,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOKtQr2yeJidH1DiabMfqQYt-vmW1NjX0IB3Z-a=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,30,,22,13,27,,32,,,30,diesel,1977,,,People also search for,,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlcVlfY21BRRAB,0,23,,,,,23,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNmXI_Fncjrj9RRbqO4BqQsujpIjhx-lRlQ5TJy=w150-h150-k-no-p,History museum,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNjeYE0z9Hr1MqiOk43PMQEXidD6SBzQw32PFyI=w150-h150-k-no-p,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNdxiepiUjAOaiRoTa8-rdyKhyc0Q2Gnp5WqxQ4=w150-h150-k-no-p,17,,215,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM3IUZP9dv54TFMKdpzaM4L5O6toIzpLeT2DgRF=w150-h150-k-no-p,17,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPq2h_f5IcIv8V9-6DLi_NwnUhsv31PGxts4Mgo=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO7boDZ0LZ4_kyPi7YlWjRphqAmUWmBLNEU9DzD=w150-h150-k-no-p,58,,,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCcnJLeUp3EAE,20,,Monday,,,,0,6,,,,,,,,,,,2 months ago,"It's a peaceful & super fantastic place to hang out with kids, adults & elderly.

Tughlaq's Tomb,,,"I visited the tomb of Yusuf Qattal last month in the Khirki village located in the congested Malviya Nagar area. Shaikh Yusuf Qattal was a Sufi saint and poet who lived in this area in the 16th century. The tomb was built in 1527 with red sandstone and is quite ornamental. Sufi saints indulged in poems and songs with the primary aim of luring the local population to convert to Islam. It has twelve pillars and a gate on the south though it looks symmetrical on all sides.The tomb is in a good condition but its surroundings are in ruins.

You get to see so many monuments of India and truly makes you feel proud of your Indian heritage. All things are made out of scrap metal and you can even see a workshop which is creating more designs as the park is expanding with more space.
Pros:
1) Very clean place, no littering, staff is present and place is monitored by CCTV
2) Easy ticketing done via cash or UPI.
3) Well laid place, user friendly, you get all details regarding the information of the monuments.
4) In house food court and small play area for kids.

Cons:
1) At 100-150 per entry it is slightly expensive for what you get to see inside the complex.
2) Parking is a nightmare. Please don't get your car, rather come in metro or cab or public transport. I nearly walked a kilometre as the road is 24*7 jam packed due to ongoing road construction which will go on for another 2-3 years
3) Play area and food court are small and not properly visible. There is no serving staff and menu card is an A4 sheet printed near the billing counter.
4) Disastrous washrooms - DONT USE THEM. You would rather be better off using the public washroom on the main road rather than inside.

You have numerous YouTube videos of this place so you can see it before planning the trip. This would help you make up your mind for the travel as it is a hassle to reach the place.",10,8,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN7OmklvvRFusxpHDLj3ukz-8EIC8VNEp0QwP4t=w150-h150-k-no-p,20,,,,22,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5TZRMNCWrstTBW1v1Un8bityDFqo_abVldZDWxIMJE=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5-br100,21,19,16,7,,1.43213E+19,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPew_I3ckIxfOiL9ilGWb40XC8QV5aH0uKU1z-o=w150-h150-k-no-p,59,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPpNOtY5JeDijCMjdMZVpypQ4tRfd8scysxWiYW=w150-h150-k-no-p,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNRoahc7s4bZ1YIIv_Cxn149AVOhk9_IyUN4Rpc=w150-h150-k-no-p,,23,12,,,,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCdi1mOVlBEAE,Tuesday,,,27335,,16,,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO8J0-VGCpEv7S8Q-Nf1joccXAGUkFPR_KCB3kB=w1920-h1080-k-no,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPMHM3OVN3EAE!2m1!1s0x0:0xc6bf6e7c5b85f76f!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDO0s79Sw%7CCgwI1638lQYQyPvFqQE%7C?hl=en-US,,8,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMTbgzp_SkKvvgPJRHRcREoZiNvp44XWdlMOS0_=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5Svc5YkwIab8ujmnY1TkzIa-skrJpjLFS8pVY30dg=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2-br100,,7,,,17,,12,2023-03-11T13:28:55.406Z,,,130,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOexnz212JDDGYNxQo7tYD0Vd1BORpb3K1QTAr0=w150-h150-k-no-p,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMRqNtW6mZvHb5eVvP0GZUG6XWrDleqxmRo_xYk=w1920-h1080-k-no,Deer Park,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPl7zOnH86KRzbGMLg2G-r9FoWSAelBmIneuIB5=w150-h150-k-no-p,"A really amazing and creative project by Govt, monuments made fully out of scrap.

The museum contains paintings, artifacts, calligraphy, fabrics and other objects dating from the Mughal era.

The Red Fort Archaeology Museum is currently housed in the Mumtaz Mahal
History	Edit
Originally known as the Palace Museum, this museum dates back to 1911[1] when it was located in the Naubhat Khana. It was later moved to the Mumtaz Mahal,[2] originally used as a mess by the British occupiers. The museum is now under the aegis of the Archaeological Survey of India.

Most of the Mughal belongings and jewels of the Red Fort were looted and stolen during Nadir Shah's invasion of India in 1747 and again after the failed Indian Rebellion of 1857 against the British colonialists. They were eventually sold to private collectors or the British Museum, British Library and the Victoria and Albert Museum. For example, the Koh-i-Noor diamond, the jade wine cup of Shah Jahan and the crown of Bahadur Shah II are all currently located in London. Various requests for restitution have been rejected by the British government.[3] The museum, therefore, is only able to show a very small fraction of Mughal property and heritage.",https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPCt46UOZHPqayC4NiwIRHrwxaSIgEPaFeu1tvq=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,Yes,,FALSE,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMuyrgm5fWZvsGxnpvZs6kOfTRxhqIE9Ntfd_uJ=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMnHsrjWeXgqO8EFLRrp5optqX-xGS0_k9fa27d=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,9,19,Museum On 1857- India's First War Of Independence,,98,"Dear readers,

Everything was very well organised our tour operator Sonia was very responsive to all questions I had during the trip. She would keep in contact on a daily basis making sure everything was running smoothly. Our
driver Ajay was amazing, he was very thoughtful, polite, kind, patient, punctual,
professional, well groomed with a great sense of humour. He certainly was an expert navigating the chaotic traffic especially in New Delhi. He always made sure we had ice cold water during our trip. His motto was if we’re happy he’s happy!! My daughter and I felt very safe with Ajay. It’s
very comforting to have a familiar, friendly face greet us every morning and brave the traffic. He also made sure we stopped at clean and safe bathrooms along the way which was greatly appreciated. We had guides at each destination specialising in their specific area. Each one was great. We chose the 5 star hotel option and the hotels were luxurious to say the least. Pankij was our first guide in Delhi. He gave us a wonderful tour of Delhi, including a very nice lunch at a local restaurant. He was extremely likeable and knowledgeable. We ended up finishing our tour early. Instead of leaving for Agra Pankij offered to take us to a Sikh Temple in
Delhi. I’m glad we went as it was a life changing experience. Raj was our second tour guide in Agra. He was very helpful taking exceptional photos of us at the Taj Mahal. Memories we will treasure for a lifetime. He was also very likeable and knowledgeable. Our third and final guide in Jaipur was Sunil. Sunil was highly skilled and very knowledgeable. He was able to explain complex history into plain english making it an enjoyable experience visiting the sites and monuments.

One of the first Mughal mausoleum's to have been built, this tomb has more Central Asian elements than the finer Mughal ones which came on later.
Though it's built on a very big scale there are harly any decorative elements on the exterior except for some Hindu Shatkone stars.
The interiors are made light by the presence of many windows and ventilators which allow inna lot of light and air.
This mausoleum was converted into a residence by an officer of the East India Company and the graves of Adham Khan and Maham Anga were relocated outside of the building.
After a while the building was even used as a post office but Lord Curzon at the beginning of the 20th century restored it and moved back Adham Khan's grave but the remains of Maham Manga were lost forever.
No entry fee and a few steps to enter but the building is used as a waiting area for those waiting to catch a bus and locals boys to play cricket.

It features an octagonal domed chamber surrounded by arched verandahs - a design not seen in any Mughal building of that period. The monuments architecture, which is distinctive of the Lodi dynasty (rivals of the Mughals), is believed to remind people of Adham Khan's treasonous act of killing Emperor Akbar's favourite General, Ataga Khan.

With people losing their way amongst its many maze-like passages, the tomb is also nicknamed Bhool Bhulaiya (labyrinth).

Shantivan and Rajghat are two different sites of same place. So it's better to visit the all together in a same day.

Timings: open from 6:30am to 6pm. Either early morning or  afternoon time is best to visit here. TRY TO AVOID THE NOON TIME.

Expense: No entry tickets, Free parking facility available.

1. Park your vehicle in the FREE PARKING AREA (near Rajghat Swachhata museum).
2. First take a look at SWACHHATA MUSEUM (Regarding the Swachhata mission of PM Narendra Modi)_it will take hardly 5-15min.
3. Then cross small road there to get in through RAJGHAT ENTRY (security check in will be done there)
4. KISHAN GHAT: (Samadhi of former PM Charan Singh)
5. RAJGHAT: Samadhi of Mahatma Gandhi. It is well maintained one out of all the samadhi here. Also there is ample greenery with rolling space around to sit and chill in the evening.
6. BIR BHUMI: samadhi of former PM Rajib Gandhi.
7. SHAKTI STHAL: samadhi of former PM Indira Gandhi
8. on the way to Shantivan: Big pond with many birds, specially in the evening time... quite a good area to hang around.
9. SHANTIVAN: here lies the samadhi of 2 former PMs - Pt Jawaharlal Nehru and a little behind, that of Sanjay Gandhi.

Overall a nice place to hang around, for half of your day. Spend a family time here and take back a good memory.

*BATHROOM/WASHROOM:
one at car parking space.

I was totally in love with this place.
Next level experience..
I was in a different world for 1½ hours.
Totally amazed by this experience.
Just go with whosoever u want, with family, with friends or with special one but avoid children for less then 5 years (that's totally my views, rest is ofcourse upto you) you won't get bored.
You can play with ice, snow i meant..you can do skating (only at ur own risk) if you know skating then only you can do, otherwise nobody will help you there) and next is sledding, this is something fun (not so scary, you will enjoy it)
NOW THINGS I PERSONALLY DON'T LIKE ARE:
1. its bit over priced like 1000/person for like 1½ hours.
2. Another Reason for 1st point is, LESS RIDES ( they only have thise two rides which i mentioned above) so yaar kitni der tak tum vo 2 chize kar loge, plus the person who don't know skating, he/she left with only sledding..so you know
NOTE: another thing is you can do skating only for 5 mins, that's what they told us.
3. The jackets and gloves they gave you are bit stinky specially gloves.
4. They told you that you have full 1½ hours but not that's not the scenario here, you have to leave the premises before 10mins so you have only 1 hour 20mins.
NOTE:
1. DON'T GO IN SHORTS OR SKIRTS, NOT A GOOD IDEA AT ALL, because its actually cold there, plus you wont feel comfortable as well.
2. Take your socks along with you, otherwise you have to pay rs. 50 to purchase it.

They provide you everything, shoes, jacket, gloves and inside you will get skating shoes too.

It was my 1st experience so overall i enjoyed it..
As i told you earlier i loved it.😊❤️",,18,,,14,People also search for,5,,0,41,19,17,,,,,,12,13,97,33,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPdzlxd0ZnEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0xeb3abf021c483c31!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICOw9qwFg%7CCgsIlui1lQYQyM-iBQ%7C?hl=en-US,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP_9DcPAVFAlxxAp9q0vOqSdgTgFPaqrPhQqkLu=w150-h150-k-no-p,29,47

Hundreds of bonsai Indian trees are on display over a well-paved and sprawling section garden which is lush green and is blessed with a cover with a think bush and vegetation. bonsai plants are well labeled and plenty of information is displayed via large boards vividly painted with pictures of the trees.
Since the park is vast and involves plenty of walking it is recommended to carry or plenty of water or an energy drink even in winter. There is also a children's play park adjacent to the park with modern play equipment.

The word Bonsai is a Japanese term which means “planted in a container”. This art form is derived from an ancient Chinese horticultural practice, part of which was then redeveloped under the influence of Japanese Zen Buddhism.

It is a wonderful place to spend a whole day with your kids. There are a lot of well designed activities which teaches them life skills and responsibilities. It gives them the pleasure of earning and spending hard-earned money. The staff was equally supportive and friendly with the students.

Bade and Chote Khan’s twin tombs are magnificent structures, colossal enough to get noticed, located in a prominent area and also in pretty good shape too, but still, hardly anyone knows about them!

It is basically a complex of twin tombs somewhat like the Dadi Poti tombs located near HKV. They form part of one of the major components of the Kotla Mubarakpur complex, which includes several other lesser known tombs, mostly from the pre-Mughal era, belonging to various kings and noblemen of the notable Lodi and Sayyid dynasties. As of now, they are scattered around the congested lanes of Kotla Mubarakpur village as well as the posh streets of the neighbouring South Extension locality

The tombs are barely a few feet apart. The authorities have now built a pathway surrounding them. Local children play cricket on the remaining space, but as a matter of fact, the compound is disproportionately small for the size of the monuments. The minimal free space is tightly surrounded by walls and beyond them lie the residential & commercial establishments and hence it is difficult to get a clear, wide view of the compound. There is another smaller tomb just a few metres away from the twin tombs. It is not in a very good shape and there are no information boards visible here either.",,3,20,Bagh-I-Alam Ka Gumbad,1.17316E+20,4,,,17,15,16,0,5,,,22,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102842643969222259718?hl=en-US,,,,"https://www.google.com/maps/search/places+to+visit+in+delhi/@28.5485116,77.2487204,13z/data=!3m1!4b1?hl=en",,,,,,,,People also search for,,,,,31,34,13,14,4,33,1,6,,4.1,61,1,10,13,9,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPREWpOM79dpH-HaO8p6jd0VTDvHI8Amn9Xuhj6=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,44,,20,11,59,,47,1,7,84,monument,,,,People also search for,,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNZaW9yejF3RRAB,4,21,,,,,32,,,,,,15,,483,,15,,,62,,,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHdjhyZ3FRRRAB,78,,Monday,,1,,1,4,64,,,,3,,0,,,13,a year ago,Good to visit in evening or morning in summer,13,evening,14,,,,,,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5QbL-r-YE0H7uBDOqw9evSp8-fL9XrGUDhyJ0Oq=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3-br100,22,1,,,Open 24 hours,14,Tourist attraction,,15,14,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPpjg1smeNwfAHnFYpR9lLfjUdOzLnUYP2gjBbn=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,28,62,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN996AAQQNE6VrylM3p53Ns2acpg4cfYPkktlKx=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,1,9,,28,,1,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5SSVGUpPQpyrMsdTZQWHcMOp_aiwgRdKk0dFfSq9OI=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3-br100,5,Open 24 hours,,11,0,Chhote Khan Tomb,1,21,,,6,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN_CYjBiMtwQEC1-sXexb9UZYv-bEikEeqSvg5J=w150-h150-k-no-p,2022-09-12T15:20:43.165Z,3,16,,13,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMJa2aGK7M8K--Q4jgMyvV1R_DT-PXYnkAIxvqe=w150-h150-k-no-p,0,1,,11,,2022-01-07T05:22:32.461Z,,8,,,,49,0,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117316478899244042314?hl=en-US,,0,5,1,13,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPQTGIzJjN0pwN_71c_j3eFTPzwru8cciShqam8=w1920-h1080-k-no,18,18,18,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1cHZ6TmNBEAE,83,tombs,,,14,,,19,,,,,1,10,20,2,,71,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMMeU60D2FcfVbbESszh2z67tm9S0RnISLrIdE5=w150-h150-k-no-p,1,19,18,45,,71,12,19,,6,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMw9NbhTSJzfnsiuftK1edNvhUC9eYO8QDM2lk7=w1920-h1080-k-no,,1,,,,5,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPWJrRjKmoERdYERCC_ShZ8DV_yVGQKDha2KYoC=w150-h150-k-no-p,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMj8rTD9lpEoR20cw6gU8a5XTKCbWd4dRK-jSLW=w150-h150-k-no-p,9,21,,,,72,17,16,21,,walking,3,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPDjeyuHaymkQAfkmRyW5y5zu8mEUNeDWCCNb9V=w150-h150-k-no-p,,20,,,19,0,23,,89,51,FALSE,,8,21,,77.2201489,18,11,42,,,FALSE,,4,1,5,,8,,69,11,,1,45,Open 24 hours,,6,79,,192,7,,31,,,1,,People also search for,,,,1,1,,,"The Bade Khan Tomb is the larger among the pair of two the other being Chhote Khan Tomb but does not appear on the maps.

Bara Lao Ka Gumbad Delhi
Not many can claim to be living in a 600 years old heritage home, but that was the case with the Bara Lao Ka Gumbad. Before Archaeological Survey of India undertook the monumental site under its care, a family had been living inside the monument for more than 3 generations. Located in the DDA Park in Vasant Vihar, the Lodi Era monument was abandoned by the authorities for a very long period of time, leading to illegal encroachments. One of the forgotten monuments in Delhi, Bara Lao Ka Gumbad once exhibited the royal architecture of Lodi dynasty. But after the encroachers started living there, the monument was converted into makeshift living place. The walls were painted and damaged which led to authorities regaining the ownership of the place. Since then, the walls have been renovated, the main tomb’s damages have been repaired and most of the monuments have been restricted to the general public in order to preserve the heritage site and ward of the encroachers.",https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMQ8t9Sjzjydgg2w8MANTUSiit2qHr8SHB8TNTF=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,0,Not yet,6,FALSE,6,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPnJk6Db-x8eAEg4zJvVvSLjj8ycsGOaoLt1SQo=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,4,89,24,,,7,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOymmn7tuPyU8dHuJHB-Qz0ABV-P3AIO2eH8Lq5=w150-h150-k-no-p,16,,11,,,,24,2,Lodhi Garden,24,85,Bada gumbad is situated inside Lodhi garden.

His tomb in Nizamuddin is one of Delhi’s lesser known but important Mughal monuments.

Built in 1598 CE as a mausoleum for Abdur Rahim’s wife Mah Banu, the tomb is a typical ‘garden tomb’. While Rahim’s Tomb looks odd on the outside, with most of the white marble cladding stripped from the dome, there’s a story behind it: when the Mughal Prime Minister Safdarjung died in the mid-1700s, the Mughal Empire was so poor that there were not sufficient funds for all the trappings of a grand tomb. Safdarjung’s Tomb had to be embellished with stolen white marble—it was taken by vandalizing Rahim’s Tomb.

As you go in at the main gate, you can first turn to the left , where a series of panels with photographs and illustrations provide details about Rahim, the tomb, and a recent restoration project. From the main gate, if you turn right and approach the tomb platform from that side, you’ll find the staircases that lead up to the platform. Beautiful incised plaster and paint decorate the tomb chamber as well as the cells lining the platform.

Entrance to Rahim’s Tomb is from Mathura Road, just a little before the Sab Burj roundabout. There is an enclosed parking space. Ticket costs are Rs 20 per adult, and you pay by scanning a QR code on your phone.",15,court,,,,,,,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5QsIEsGhOIcMe0MHUKKA12fl9R6h20mp-AbJnCqNQ=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5-br100,,,,,10 AM to 5 PM,16,Historical landmark,,17,16,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNSwc9uLmIn6ko2JvKA09Hjl1eXNwdjZ0XRRJE_=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,53,73,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPP38WljdpUaW_of1UCBCKifNTi0tOl7UfMVUt8=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOeOAlabxzrkEuxkJc-mSRTM6ItfGNpF2aZUoxL=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipONemLBOSZ7cfSpZvQRcvX2DWO_tND22urJ9ygV=w150-h150-k-no-p,,0,11,,44,,,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5SB8yHP8hU6mEPoEA7uw01d83bvKoLKgTA6fJUqZQ=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6-br100,7,10 AM to 5 PM,,13,1,Isa Khan's Tomb,,23,,,0,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNES2FHCXhq0XoNA6oceannv2zww2AbJwKjuild=w150-h150-k-no-p,2023-02-25T20:26:50.981Z,5,18,,15,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNcKIIrk0lfN4-BeEV41cuynz9mFNchedcI7nSf=w150-h150-k-no-p,,0,,53,,2022-12-24T15:47:54.485Z,,0,,,,0,0,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112250715318415900559?hl=en-US,,,,0,15,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOcZTAAwVpVSlZKIWLRSm11EUZ8wLOUrzKVIdJf=w1920-h1080-k-no,20,45,20,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCdnJQRUhnEAE,,akbar,,,16,,,21,,en,Ashish,,5,12,22,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNqvAh8zC_-hQKqVzuf4ZiKsr1U4wFGqbX0IilK=w150-h150-k-no-p,0,5,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPsP1wWY7GLNu0_3lsU5mTwcDjBzleKCKMi4i8d=w150-h150-k-no-p,,21,20,2724,,54,14,21,,8,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPXrJCJQ1skmnB-C4ccNgrBXfdLAnUEhstAgUla=w1920-h1080-k-no,,0,,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114852221089438943908,7,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOSF-0XPvUwKeyZv1r4sQBdU_2K38g0XKbWgVMT=w150-h150-k-no-p,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPwDlUZWc1ERHtJoMorrusnx57x6TKKE67Gin4Z=w150-h150-k-no-p,0,23,,,,59,49,18,23,,humayun's tomb,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOlHIj95Am1twX_5E44YNmgH8B90YSMi06l-7QR=w150-h150-k-no-p,,22,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNTXL8MmdnX9VcdE2vXYrVrYcG8_v0szWySeI51=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPhV_AYLAf-Dku3ZlhD9MaxzS80G7KjEs2z5C4E=w150-h150-k-no-p,21,7,,,0,0,FALSE,,10,23,,77.248014,0,13,0,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMncKHYy_frKOvRdD6HQAeFOTuZruw-X1i7YwaL=w150-h150-k-no-p,,FALSE,17-Dec,6,,,,0,,59,13,,,0,10 AM to 5 PM,Shanky Aggarwal,8,100,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNmGP0XccThseAyaX277Y0ONKdjSRMZLqqaNZ2i=w150-h150-k-no-p,160,22,,0,,,,,People also search for,,,,0,,,,"This place is not crowded, you can go anytime.

Imam Zamin was a direct descendant of Muhammad and his original name was Muhammad Ali. Zamin was thus a Sayyid and belonged to the Chishti sect of Sufism. It is believed that he migrated from Turkestan to Delhi during the reign of Sultan Sikandar Lodi, and subsequently became the imam (chief priest) of the Quwwat-ul-Islam mosque, at the Qutb Minar complex.

According to the inscription on the entrance, the mausoleum was built by Zamin between 1537 and 1538 during the reign of Humayun. He died in 1539. Located east of the Alai Darwaza, the tomb was constructed long after the original group of monuments and was the last addition to the Qutb Minar complex.

The tomb is built in the Lodhi architectural style. The mausoleum is square in shape and measures 7.3 metres (24 ft) in both length and breadth. The roof is supported by twelve pillars and is surmounted by a sandstone dome with jalis on all the sides, except the west and south.The dome rises from an octagonal drum and is decorated with a marble panel above the chhajja (overhanging eaves or cover of a roof) along with a double row of crenelles. Marble is extensively used for the interior ornamentation and in the construction of the cenotaph. The western side of the mausoleum contains a marble-wrought mihrab (niche in the wall of a mosque that indicates the direction towards which the Muslims pray).The entrance, located at the southern side, is also made of marble.
The entire sandstone structure was originally covered by polished stucco, a portion of which is still extant.

This temple is dedicated to Goddess, Katyayani. The entire complex of the temple is spread over a wide area of 70 acres. It is located at Chhatarpur, on the southwestern outskirts of the New Delhi and is just 4 km from Qutub Minar, off Mehrauli-Gurgaon road. The temple was established in 1974, by Baba Sant Nagpal ji, who died in 1998. His samadhi shrine lies in the premises of the Shiv-Gauri Nageshwar Mandir within the temple complex.

A unique feature of this monument is also its tapered walls that are unusual for the architecture of those times.

I visited this tomb at the same time as the Tughlakabad Fort since this place is right across the road that ruptures the causeway that originally connected the tomb with the fort. In the medieval period, there was a bog on either side of the causeway making it impossible to cross over from the tomb site to the fort.

In the middle of this space is the mausoleum that hosts the tomb of Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq and his wife. The entrance suggests that this was originally a Hindu temple that was repurposed for a tomb according to the tour guide. The parts of the Kalash that adorned the original temple are well preserved and can be seen even today in one of the storage rooms within the complex.

You will found lots of couple hanging around,  I will suggest to visit this on Sunday Evening so you will find some families also. Because most of the time it's best for couples. Some of the orthodox mentality can be disturbed. It's a beautiful place. You will find your self in midst of nature. Car Parking is available near by. So its a good hanging around place.

1) If you actually are here for bird watching, you might need to walk a lot. There's a straight stretch of about 5 km where people usually walk. It is quite scenic and beautiful but usually you can't spot many birds unless you look closely. However, once you cross that 5 km mark and take a left turn or so, the real wildlife becomes visible as not many people come till here (I found a peacock wing and an undisclosed bone here)
2) Canteen is only at the entry, so don't expect anything if you get hungry or thirsty midway.
3) High tension power lines are just above your head so you can hear it humming which felt quite exciting to me

along the main road, Indraprastha Park spreads over approximately 72 acres of green lawns, with paths, trees, flowering bushes and more. The main gate is near the park’s most visible landmark, the beautiful white marble Buddhist stupa. You can go through the stone gateway here (which looks like the one at the Sanchi stupa) and climb up to the stupa, but you must take off your shoes before going up. The area beyond the lawns immediately surrounding the stupa have been landscaped in an imitation Japan style, with stone lanterns, a mock Mt Fuji, and so on.

A low fence separates the stupa enclosure from the rest of the park. Just that side of the fence is a very popular children’s play area, and beside that, a sort of outdoor food court where snacks, soft drinks, etc can be bought.

No entry fee is charged for Indraprastha Park or the stupa.",9,6,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM7IkMvYVmYypkW8icYyp-aa7-UD5BqLtkowsg-=w150-h150-k-no-p,6,,TRUE,,21,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5SUBuyQ2QJYGktm6cRuDHognN8Ou-tpuLEo0z2QnA=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5-br100,17,18,15,6,,5.44886E+18,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPIKApTQzihhtjcX2-egSuKR7CuUzTSQAOQVs2-=w150-h150-k-no-p,23,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN3FG3NPdhsNWqlIzFJdwQP9AIasSfzm10y6a7g=w150-h150-k-no-p,0,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOSt9Tidnu8L7GQI8U0QMaAWJytcajaHkmecz20=w150-h150-k-no-p,,22,11,,,,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1aTl6cFlREAE,Tuesday,,,8774,,15,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOn_HV2u_eXcUy0kguFfUUFOOs00lf0BJCv1QmK=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOo84oE5qHHnX3InQryf8j7nqi4E-dVdfsg7f6K=w1920-h1080-k-no,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMya3F6RVl3EAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x4b9e4046911786e1!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIC2kqzEYw%7CCgwIrMfskgYQ6NOQiwE%7C?hl=en-US,,7,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOgtvMB9QGA-y_0lywrkUG_rS-nfMM-1IPsZWPr=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5RlotGUkpI_iHL_3ibarDmiWRzD1aWbZLG0PTi2aw=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4-br100,,6,,,16,21,11,2023-03-11T13:36:58.375Z,1,,242,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPzmYBMbCYu63D_WRhXHPRqSFHW8PfS6yxAiDOS=w150-h150-k-no-p,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNbB5otHuSB8eOJjuau8pzb2oC3AmzvPYMjveST=w1920-h1080-k-no,Park delhi,,,"A wonderful start of your day when you choose this park for your walk.

September on Sunday around 1 pm.I would suggest to go early and if you can manage then go on weekdays for less rush otherwise you have to wait for 15-20 minutes for every ride. This time amusement park was closed only waterpark was open but I did not like is ticket price which was very high i.e,1450/per person (even amusement park was closed there was no concession).
But i am highly recommending you to book tickets online as there is ticket price is 999/ per person which is reasonable on its official website. According to me that was bad thing people who was spending their time in queue spending more.
Carry your own nylon costumes to avoid extra expenses. On weekends there was no offer like concession on couple entry charges . Locker charges are 200/per locker and security deposit is 250 / per locker which was refundable but if you loose your locker key then no refund amount you will get.you can buy drinking water,food ,ice cream or other eatable stuff on little hiked price inside the park,you can carry mobile phone as well but for that you have to carry plastic cover which cost you 250(with no 100% guarantee).... overall it was amazing experience,all rides are very thrilling and adventurous.

In my experience the place is good to visit with family and friends, I suggest come as soon as possible so you have adequate time to enjoy every ride. As we visited on Sunday there's rush in the park, full with people and there's long queue for every slide and ride. The scariest one is highest yellow slide which is heart throbbing, one will fall in seconds, and on reaching down they realise it was most mesmerizing experience. The four person yellow slide was not functioning at the time of our visit but rest violet, red and green slides were awesome. The flip slide on mat was also good one. Both the wave pool is over crowded but the experience was memorable when wave comes everyone enjoys. The lazy river is another fun filled activity, people were fighting at the end of journey as no one wants to come out of it😂😂. There's long waiting for it due to this, everyone inter- locked and jam the passage so they can stay a little longer..",,wave pool,,,,,,,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5Q2qyfs7g1aA1aMrukTqCqSRzVZxFNLhVP6Y2OyTw=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4-br100,,,,,10 AM to 7 PM,,Theme park,,,,TRUE,TRUE,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNpOQgeNdS_hlP2P9yOJ7Giz1Cu24676zGDLATN=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOZbJkdNfbUedhjybXk2XKd18dg9SkDTtUX7rCF=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO3z1Trr0mH8GZxGTGh0jc-p_yfv6zvnAXVi9bf=w150-h150-k-no-p,,TRUE,,,,,,,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5Ss4CdkK2PEqNpG6-WM-ea58h9xq7rd2AtfkpkceA=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3-br100,,10 AM to 7 PM,,,3,The Great India Place Theme Park,,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOSlUiw4jExeyGOH_mtArGg-SGLkoMhMp_2AGs6=w150-h150-k-no-p,2022-09-13T12:48:37.063Z,4,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPoE5L6eckGdwdBgmvAZ73JbQt4evkBcvSh4Lbt=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,2022-08-29T12:03:07.856Z,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPzVqAXGH7lN2ONd-5QuPPO6U04H4RSYL-mU3dC=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106840866379580268995?hl=en-US,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO1QE-JaeBDljHWh7768y5uWA_Crr2h1WgQneyV=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1ajhTcVNBEAE,,water park,,,,Water park,,,,en,Swati Singh,,22,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOqpiRzAv1Uo558o8XRRkHlq7lZXW2J3GrwFByv=w150-h150-k-no-p,,9,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN2pjMXbGDjGjJGMdDRUpbyYomokQs1QciCJPDG=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,1322,,,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNPUVzGSUkY1CgHCj2qtDDKiL8_9GfKdnUFEP_V=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111319131801828715320,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMoBR6_UzwpC3ZEi9JJQvGO0dVP_pEkhucYLhwV=w150-h150-k-no-p,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMPFZOGNmaJVg4OhOCAV-S0xLPIy3o7-YeVJV0W=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,,,,well,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP05A3EFh7QssyPB13Cdr-9YPAGQYjJOuSJsnlM=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,37,,,,,FALSE,,,,,77.3261607,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMQVembLqcNdKCb3-hMspq3KcgvUeO8Gil4QAe8=w150-h150-k-no-p,,FALSE,free fall,,,,,,,,,,,,10 AM to 7 PM,Deepak tiwari,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOGW7tQY5B0OUW8qINHs40Gx6s05s9SoKrfUwqy=w150-h150-k-no-p,7225,1364,,,,,,,People also search for,,,,,,,,"WOW is really very Amazing place to have fun with best water slides in water park and the location is near Noida sector 18 metro station near GIP Mall it's a great place to spent your day and have an amazing experience but the food inside the WoW is very very expensive and u need to shell more money.

The intricate and beautiful architecture of the monument left me breathless.
The surrounding Qutub Complex also has a rich history, with several historic tombs and other structures that provide a fascinating glimpse into India's past. The intricate carvings and designs on the walls of the various structures within the complex are stunning and offer a wonderful example of the rich cultural heritage of India.
I was particularly impressed with the informative displays that explain the history and significance of each structure within the Qutub Complex. These displays were helpful in understanding the rich history and significance of the monument and its surroundings.
Overall, Qutub Minar is a must-visit for anyone interested in history, architecture, and culture.

Rajon Ki Baoli Delhi
Delhi was never a city with abundant water and despite having the Yamuna as its major source of water, Delhi always faced a water crisis. During medieval times, the kings commissioned the construction of Baolis all across Delhi to tackle the water crisis. The scorching summer heat made most of the surrounding areas of Mehrauli city arid and dry and these Baolis used to serve as water for irrigation and water reserve. Mehrauli has such numerous Baolis made during 15th and 16th century. One such surviving Baoli is the Rajao ki Baoli. Rajon translated means Masons, not kings. This is the common misconception about the origin of the Baoli. Named after the masons that were working there, Rajon Ki Baoli served as an important part of the Mehrauli City. The three-storey structure seems to unfold and emerge as you approach closer. Made out of rocks, the Baoli is similar to other Baolis built during the 15th and 16th century. The three-storeyed structure can be accessed through the steps and each storey has a unique structure. A feat of architecture, the Baoli still remains tall amidst the ruins of other monuments of the Mehrauli Archaeological Park. Visitors can walk across the platforms on each storey.",15,clean,,,,,,,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AGNmyxaqNbDeuonKa9SVxiGugDUYEHTg8kGzNdjp-bGy9g=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4-br100,,,,,10 AM to 5 PM,16,Archaeological site,,17,16,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOMOO-yrkTz2WLTbdDedDf86LsogjoDbqQHAPM6=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,62,47,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMNH5xQX_yFnxr3tsgIqgw5H5h8Vhr9N6QztBAE=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,0,11,,71,,,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5SIA9VVGKxVHMB84ZbWMKhF5pSeUUbwJ0zQHdQnIQ=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3-br100,7,10 AM to 5 PM,,13,3,Mehrauli Archaeological Park Jamali Kamali,,23,,,0,,,2023-02-04T04:28:36.535Z,5,18,,15,,,0,,21,,2023-01-02T15:09:22.451Z,,0,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMt--LD6izOqHwCaqSmfK-M0uqo8cuGf0uURRpk=w150-h150-k-no-p,0,0,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107320788248947527498?hl=en-US,,,,0,15,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM7FFlHxJY3u3_5rPzmODMmavqkq8fOn1KyzLaD=w1920-h1080-k-no,20,42,20,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCckphYXdnRRAB,,structure,,,16,,,21,,,Sumit Raut,,0,12,22,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNfkDkgrkLCIQIPxlvGiscZDBP2Vmp4olH_o9FF=w150-h150-k-no-p,0,5,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO5iWVi8YXZMkwjGM8z1_nd_N-rSH4BmDLBgqZb=w150-h150-k-no-p,,21,20,2371,,25,14,21,,8,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPic0fFKMiJrl2ETe8Tm-NebDXiSDTqkrqAq9oo=w1920-h1080-k-no,,0,,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105217210366811158663,7,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNpFZ_hmAwWS1ycfcn9KKWL_aMeB3PFuaLpUp0b=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,0,23,,,,32,35,18,23,,park,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOy2cWRnisMvTEmvvsMoAjO_AsZ0uPcd9nSMmGn=w150-h150-k-no-p,,22,,,21,1,,,0,0,FALSE,,10,23,,77.1834136,0,13,0,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOdEmxfV8BXc1g9-3ByejMQ2twxVpmtHU2pwsjE=w150-h150-k-no-p,,FALSE,named,6,,,,0,,49,13,,,0,10 AM to 5 PM,Santosh Chaudhary,8,79,,3,19,,0,,,,,People also search for,,,,0,,,,Need maintenance  ..

They have so many artefacts and fun activities to offer, it all makes your visit worth it. The ticket price starts with 70rs and it increases as you add activities you want to do inside the museum like the 3D show, Hollow show etc. One thing I would like to mention is that their ticket selling service is bad. There are only 2 counters. It took me around 40 minutes to buy 2 tickets and I didn't get to see other shows as they were already full because they have limited seats for each show. So I would suggest you go as early as you can go if you want to enjoy every activity. Apart from this, you'll have an amazing inside.

Make plan to come here during 𝘀𝗽𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 or 𝗮𝘂𝘁𝘂𝗺𝗻.
Go as early in the day as possible.

History:-

The 𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 who built it in 𝟭𝟲𝟱𝟴 also built the 𝗧𝗮𝗷 𝗠𝗮𝗵𝗮𝗹.

Advice:

One advise plan to book the entry ticket one day before. Too 𝗰𝗿𝗼𝘄𝗱𝗲𝗱 place.

Bring something to drink because there is no place to 𝗯𝘂𝘆 𝗱𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗸𝘀.

Opinion:-

The architecture of 𝗥𝗲𝗱 𝗙𝗼𝗿𝘁 is beyond imagination❤️.

I had visited the place today and found it very good. The ambience is so colourful. Each personality statue seems so original as if they are really standing with you. I personally liked Michael Jackson statue a lot. Each personality has own accessories also so that we can feel the same while clicking the pictures. Its a great place to visit.",,18,,,14,People also search for,5,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNfdW0VKsACgNbMxylQYdsnLfMWINbnp5oAPEiH=w150-h150-k-no-p,0,44,19,17,,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ggms/AF1QipOZepMGXZjWyiX1SJZEdABzZXAQuGdWfSLWW252=m18,,,,12,13,83,0,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMtazYySkpBEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0xc4aae24963ebaa9c!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIC-k62JJA%7CCgwIsqG_mwYQ-KbV1QE%7C?hl=en-US,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNVzpHxVisXela3ycd-X0pL5k5_rXELglhprKrL=w150-h150-k-no-p,16,47

The place is centrally located and well connected with metro as well as by road. The site has spacious lush green lawns well maintained by N.D.M.C. The greenery around is a treat for eyes and has a soothing effect on one's mind. The big statue of Gandhiji and Charkha on entering the venue reminds us of our rich heritage and legacy in 75th year of Indian Independence being celebrated as Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav.
The place often hosts different kinds of events. Food festival has been organised from 19th August, 2022 to 21st August, 2022. Though the cost of  entrance ticket is Rs 20 on the other days it is free during the food festival. This festival has brought together under one roof different players in the industry showcasing and selling their delicacies to the visitors thronging the place from different parts of city. Many stalls have been put up selling different food items ranging from North Indian Amritsary Naan, Missi Roti and Saag to stall put up by renowned   South Indian group Sarvan selling South Indian Sambar Vadas, Rasam and many other items. There have been stalls put up by big reputed brands like Haldi Ram and Khandani Pakoda Wala selling chaat and different kinds of delicious pakodas. The special attraction of the festival is the food items prepared in the utensils of mud or clay. The tea and coffee offered in kulhads made of mud and food items prepared and served in these kinds of  utensils of mud have been the biggest draw. The music and dance performed in the background by the artists adds  charm to the experience.
The place has a record of holding such splendid events.",,15,22,mahatma Gandhi museum,1.12092E+20,6,,,19,128,18,1,7,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111584251964247108454?hl=en-US,,,,"https://www.google.com/maps/search/places+to+visit+in+delhi/@28.5485116,77.2487204,13z/data=!3m1!4b1?hl=en",,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOecRTaDr23SgwyGXn_E6KZfaJHGIZvxd8-bMQj=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,People also search for,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMO6srjO5eAuvZW-RUchgf2PTE5ZSU8whWswavg=w150-h150-k-no-p,,0,19,0,0,20,206,,8,,4.1,13,0,2,15,11,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNahFChq29S4SnwSSr_BtOoYu8tbW7oWfk-6jN6=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,12,,22,13,10,,7,,9,11,chakra,stainless steel,,,People also search for,,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPMEtqT0VnEAE,0,23,,,,,6,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOGvvDQo90_SYh9W6bJE4wF4a4OBPBYbb1fpcih=w150-h150-k-no-p,Museum,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNdvvrPIEuz4Rs607fw6lv9EGKjEXjJZRMjA23f=w150-h150-k-no-p,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipObAZWZe4kOdakIJNuCHi_ETXI3S4IOBj77hqQ_=w150-h150-k-no-p,17,,5175,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNkurdK-6BKJg3QQDM4L2M97WOU5cYwmloSjO3A=w150-h150-k-no-p,17,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMGcYIqQt4E1_sKcETYEzIPZsOXOleY7Kiycfhp=w150-h150-k-no-p,,15,,,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1anZiR3h3RRAB,15,,Monday,,,,0,6,18,,,,,,,,,15,6 months ago,"This charkha museum (spining wheel museum) is one of it's kind, here you can see charkha's made of before the independence of India.

I visited this place on November 2019.
This is an Archaeological Site.
Nearest metro station is Hauz Khas Metro station.
You will need to buy ticket to enter this place because it is maintained by Archaeological Survey of India.

Also called as manokamna (fulfilment) temple. The other name is seedha Peetha.
The main observation is , when the temple Aarti goes on between (8 to 8 30), the people who stand in queue will see the flags on top of temple symmetrically moving and when it stops, the flag movement stops to pin drop. The temple has many doors , which they open subsequently.
Best time to go it beyond 9 pm as there is no rush
Also the coconut offering in the temple is sacred and surprisingly none of the coconut are discarded. They are all collected
Don’t forget to visit bhairav ji ka temple
Kalka Mata is avatar of parvathi, who took the roop to kill Asur and her upper lips were touching clouds and lower lips moutains,so that all the blood was taken by her without any spillage so that they are not born again.
Mainly visited by females more than males.
Also , next to the temple is lotus Buddha temple but it closes by 5 pm, so plan the visit accordingly if you need to cover both the places.
Ahead of it is ISKCON temple, which closes at 9 pm.
Just outside temple is fire place where one can offer coconut to fire which is considered to be sacred.

Situated in the Nizamuddin West area of Delhi, the dargah is visited by thousands of pilgrims every week.[1] The site is also known for its evening qawwali devotional music sessions. The descendants of Nizamuddin Auliya look after the whole management of dargah Sharif.The tombs of Amir Khusrau, Nizamuddin's disciple, and Jehan Ara Begum, Shah Jahan's daughter, are located at the entrance to the complex.[4] Ziauddin Barani[5] and Muhammad Shah are also buried here.[6] Overall, the dargah complex has more than 70 graves.[7]

The complex was renovated and restored by the Aga Khan Trust for Culture around 2010.Nizamuddin's tomb has a white dome. The main structure was built by Muhammad bin Tughluq in 1325, following Nizamuddin's death. Firuz Shah Tughlaq later repaired the structure and suspended four golden cups from the dome's recesses. Nawab Khurshid Jah of Hyderabad’s legendary Paigah Family gifted the marble balustrade that surrounds the grave. The present dome was built by Faridun Khan in 1562. The structure underwent many additions over the years.[9] The dome is about six metres in diameter.[10]

The dargah is surrounded by a marble patio and is covered with intricate jalis (transl. trellis walls).[6] The dargah complex also has a wazookhana (transl. wash basin).[11][12]Next to the dargah is the Jamat Khana Masjid. This mosque is built of red sandstone[13] and has three bays. Its stone walls are carved with inscriptions of texts from the Quran. The mosque has arches that have been embellished with lotus buds, in addition to the facade of its dome having ornamental medallions. The structure was built during the reign of Alauddin Khalji by his son Khizr Khan. Completed between 1312 and 1313, Khizr was responsible for the central dome and hall, and was a follower of Nizamuddin. Around 1325, when Muhammad bin Tughlaq took over the reign, he constructed the two adjoining halls, each of which has two domes. The southern hall, chhoti masjid (transl. small mosque) is restricted to women and features a wooden door. The large dome of the mosque features a golden bowl that is suspended from the centre.",,,,,,People also search for,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1NUwtOExnEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x79e0b03d96a8efe8!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICu5L-8Lg%7CCgwIuu_llgYQ-KepqQI%7C?hl=en-US,,,

It's clear that a lot of thought and care has gone into the design of the garden, and it shows in every detail.

In addition to the gorgeous flowers, there were plenty of stalls selling everything from gardening tools to beautiful flower arrangements. I found myself perusing the various stalls and enjoying the lively atmosphere. It's clear that this garden is not just a beautiful space, but a thriving community hub as well.

To enter the garden, you do need to purchase a ticket, but in my opinion, it's worth every penny.

Spread over 320 acres, the vast grounds of the Rashtrapati Bhavan are home not only the head of state, but also staff quarters, stables, offices and the beautiful and famed Mughal Gardens.

The Rashtrapati Bhavan was designed by British architect, Edwin Lutyens and is a unique amalgamation of Mughal and European architecture. Such is the grandeur of this mansion that very few residences of heads of states from around the world can match up to the extravagance that is the Rashtrapati Bhavan. Situated at the eastern edge of Rajpath, the Rashtrapati Bhavan faces the India Gate, which lies at the Western edge of the same road.

On either side of the Rashtrapati Bhavan lie the North Block and South Block, which house various ministries of the Government of India. The lavish Mughal Gardens lie behind the North Block and South Block, which opens to the public from mid-February to mid-March. Apart from this you can also enjoy a guided tour of a few section of the Rashtrapati Bhavan, such as the Durbar Hall, Lutyens’ Gallery, Long Drawing Room, Ashoka Hall, Children’s Gallery and Gift Museum which have now been opened to the public.

Opening Closing Time

Friday to Sunday 9 am to 4 pm. The Mughal Gardens remain closed on Mondays.

Entrance Fee

recommend you, you need to visit here in the  evening because lighting is awesome Here. But you'll not get the real color of wonders. All the things are painted with dark golden (almost brownish shade)  color.
The area near Eiffel Tower is not so wide, which is a drawback because at the time of taking photos, you have to suffer with photo's angles.
But you'll get concrete/ metal benches near Eiffel Tower and a few other areas just to sit with whom you are visiting,
At the last place you'll get a beautiful light colored waterfall(झरना)  and just in front of that waterfall you'll get a big area with benches to sit.
Food is also available there so there is no need to worry and you'll get good quality of food.
Prices are not so high,
Overall, the place is good to hang out with your friends but you'll not get any activity like rides,etc. so if you are an adventure lover so this place is not for you as a viewer you can visit here.",10,22,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNk0NUsSo2Mfe9ZlLZ8gP5J0WCMbsWo0ZFCb08=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOWRN_S3xLdM1fwSE-EDMubbw8pFiYAVnGxssA=w150-h150-k-no-p,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMAVxjV3cpnLtAzCzfH1vj8Q26zVqVZNDTHhvk7=w150-h150-k-no-p,0,,,,22,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5Sa6WJq_ANAql0Z-y7-41lr30kKsYrSK27wBn_Dzg=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4-br100,107,19,16,7,,1.39392E+18,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPyECtfbgghUV0WRUJ-nJsH3dEVsZwj0Be8yUWK=w150-h150-k-no-p,34,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOFcxG5wkKeS5_xfAho_Y11k7YAZeTh7g-5v5Bk=w150-h150-k-no-p,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPyWBWaQqbyK-ndhaeBrgYYxwEfx7O9uqN5XyUh=w150-h150-k-no-p,,23,12,,,,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCMl9hS0t3EAE,Tuesday,,,93101,,16,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOpfJhVy_YO2cVy20RsMI2CuobkMzPzBS_r1BAy=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP9W1AEGNkTKgYwl8cQHWRQ59BnE7AdxQLT1hqf=w1920-h1080-k-no,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtM2ZfYmhBRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x135833a46d820c34!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgID-3f_bhAE%7CCgwIk-zBnAYQ2LPv_AI%7C?hl=en-US,,8,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNVAOOG95psomdgl7PTi9d8cSF0gAvTtPli6d9e=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPSSC0fwuxubVqnY3p7vTQQDr92TpP57pHrPWw=w150-h150-k-no-p,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM0zsDVuqd3Wx8b-N5KlXvv454FnWBEU6cKefg=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5QvAdI70-nF7Mh_gXtbpJXixyFl2eZA_yUqpJzr=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3-br100,,7,,,17,,12,2023-03-11T13:49:30.607Z,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMqbI3UEG80qS4uqnPKP8xDQTHkDutDUP3vuH0=w150-h150-k-no-p,885,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMlb5-AGFP7t2wCrwUjf8Nvp8NKd4tGhHt4WJc=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPWJ7K2JoCrqo6RVoWar1SsM9pkbVvfwcG1Xo8j=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNf531TDoWOv1wxaq88FRmplcJzFSvXjkPiNoyp=w1920-h1080-k-no,Eiffel Tower- WOW,,,"A beautiful green and peaceful place with the dummy of 7 wonders of word.

Indira Gandhi. It was fascinated with articles of our honorable Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and how she used to live at those times. Got a tad bit emotional to see her sari in which Indira Gandhi was murdered. Feels  deeply sad about this dynamic Lady assinated by her own security guard.

Let alone going to a toilet museum. So if you're not a happening person in that sort, it definitely is a place to visit. It is not that large but whatever that they have, is very detailed and interestingly put. There I learnt that our religious scriptures have two different toilet etiquettes for married people and bachelors. Also, various historical facts regarding toilets are an interesting read too.
My most favourites were all the toilet related jokes and one liners that have appeared in different newspapers of the world. I hope you have fun here, cheers!

There are two parts to the museum: an outdoor area and an indoor one. The outdoor one is devoted to Sulabh's work of setting up cheap, eco-friendly toilets that are accessible to all. Under an outdoor covered stretch, there are lots of different models of toilets. The indoor area is where they have lots of very interesting text, photos, models (and actual toilets!) about hygiene, sanitation and toilets from around the world and across the ages.

The text is well-written, the exhibits carefully curated and very informative. The problem is that it's not very thoughtfully arranged; most of the text is in the form of framed sections, the paper all yellowed, the images faded. Sometimes the text is hung too high to be easily visible, and some of it is just too much text, without much relief.

But, despite those drawbacks, still an amazingly interesting museum.

The Garden of Five Senses in Delhi is a paradise for nature lovers, away from the city centre. It is an amalgamation of natural beauty and man-made art.

Not in a mood to return back from the place.. It was so nice to stay there whole day.. It's really a memorable day.. The place is so nice. Inside not allowed due to security reasons. But the view from outside is really amazing...Unfortunately, the area around the gate is closed due to the pandemic still, but wow is it beautiful! We came here to take some pictures and just enjoy the view for a while!

I recommend coming by to at least witness this beauty from the outside of the gate since it is extremely iconic and important for India!It was awesome time visiting India Entryway, New Delhi with all my old buddies.

Better to visit in weekdays completely avoid weekends.

You only get 1-Hour of timeslot to hover around and click pictures.

It is divided into 3-sections (20-minute for each section).

Like the concept and things they bring to your notice and a visual treat to watch.

Best part they have aligned team members, who not just help in directing things to you but they even help to click your picture in a decent way (Not for all sections they will help but they do for main sections)

They also have a small cafeteria, but you'll hardly get time to go.

They also have a store section from where you can purchase their merchandise and products.

Staff has been great with everyone. Kudos to the team.

It was built by tughlaqs. As it's name Bhuli Bhatiyari is not perfect Bhooti Bhatiyari is perfect name for this fort.

You can also visit Bhuli Bhatiyari jungle which is located just near to it. To come here you can get down at Jhandewalan metro station.

If you get scare you can visit later to hanuman temple of Karol Bagh 😅

Someone rightly said: “Stare at the dark too long and you will eventually see what isn’t there.” Rings true for most of the places that are haunted. One such place is Bhuli Bhatiyari Ka Mahal at Jhandewalan near Karol Bagh. I had come across several articles, videos and social media posts about the place being haunted. Some said that this place is so spooky, no guard has been able to work here for more than one day. And that screams of women and children as if they were getting beaten up can be heard at this spot. You will find several stories about the place on Internet.

One story says that inside the mahal lives a queen who had died 600 years ago, and that her ghost is seen here at night. Another says a person named Boo Ali Bakhtiyari ruled here, and the place was named after him and later people modified the name to Bhooli Bhatyari for theease of pronunciation. Another says that a woman named Bhuri from the Bhatiyar tribe in Rajasthan, lost her way and reached this palace. One day, Muslim ruler Sultan Feroz Shah Tughlaq came here.

He was thirsty, so she offered him water and he named the place after her name, and since she had forgotten her way, it was named Bhooli Bhatiyari. When Bhuri died, she possessed this place. But if the historians are to be believed this was built in the 13th century by Tughl aqasa hunting lodge. Bhooli Bhatiyari Ka Mahal is under the Arc h a e o - logical Survey of India and currently being restored.",,18,22,Bhool Bhulaiya,1.17076E+20,6,,,19,108,18,13,7,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104457667950302717354?hl=en-US,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110275027271247452285,,,"https://www.google.com/maps/search/places+to+visit+in+delhi/@28.5485116,77.2487204,13z/data=!3m1!4b1?hl=en",,,,,,,,People also search for,,,,,0,0,0,0,19,355,,8,,4,37,0,23,15,11,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipONe9pt8wu3yIApKbUmBZvWkFbdKEWTY4HTtLKf=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,33,,22,13,37,,100,,9,41,firoz shah tughlaq,hanuman,,,People also search for,,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURXOExIb3B3RRAB,18,23,,,,,46,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNx1fEE-ej9vSEah42r098Sh7cXbqBKvBJwmcQw=w150-h150-k-no-p,Historical place,,,,17,,13,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPvrHSg-rJfWLezhcuAnH68UM4Z32vSQQAqHrcY=w150-h150-k-no-p,17,,,71,,,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPNlBtb0VREAE,43,,Monday,,,,0,6,43,,,,,,,,,15,8 months ago,"Bhuli Bhatiyari ka mahal.
