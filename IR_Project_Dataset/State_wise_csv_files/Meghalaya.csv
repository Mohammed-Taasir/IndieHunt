The process was very smooth. Lindsay was very patient and answered all the queries we had in 2-3 weeks before the caving.
We were assigned 2 guides during the caving, though our group had only 3 of us. Both the guides were knowledgeable, were giving lots of information during the caving.
The cave itself is very beautiful. We had to crawl at a few places and walk thru cold water. Basic fitness is needed.

Second, unlike other places in Meghalaya, the staff where extremely disrespectful to us and very rude.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.google.com/maps/search/meghalaya+places+to+visit/@25.4477479,91.2600632,10z/data=!4m2!2m1!6e1?hl=en",,True,,,,,False,,"Lovely place. A hidden treasure. ❤️ Went when it was not that much a commercialized place yet, around 2 years back.

One will have to take a vehicle from Pynursla for like 10-12km, then you will have to park your vehicle there and you will have to trek for like 3-4km. There are two routes for trek. Take the one which you will have to climb down through trees roots and all water will be flowing all over. That is quite thrilling. This route is right next to the parking spot. While climbing back, you can take the 2nd route, that is made up of normal stones steps.

If one can ask someone, there is another spot around 200mtrs before reaching the above mentioned location parking spot. There is just a tall tree where you have to climb through ladders made up of that trees roots and branches. That gives am awesome view of the sunset in the evening.

Thank you.",,1,2023-03-14T19:32:00.139Z,,,,,2022-08-12T02:54:41.483Z,People also search for,Wahumkhat falls,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Law kyntang Pynshang Raid Nongblai,,,4,,5,,,220,,,Kynton-Sa-Ir,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.6,109,,,IN,,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURxcWRTQm9BRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x7da75e68631e15a!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDqqdSBoAE%7CCgwI8YHXlwYQ8Ma05gE%7C?hl=en-US,,,False,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMM67BmXYY-f6LArpe8Rqcqne3VHhcSgazFbdwv=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,,,,2,"Tourist Attraction in Amkoi, Meghalaya, IN.

Would be about 15 mins walk from the car park on a well laid path. The path is mostly flat with some stairs right at the end.

A must visit place .
Be well dressed in terms of good shoes and comfortable dress to walk 4+4 km up n down.
The train is mix of up and down on both ways.
It's fantastic , enthralling, mesmerizing and photogenic place.

This is unique and one of only place in India where u walk on bamboos for such a long distance.
End point is most fantastic and beautiful ...don't miss that...
Once u reach the top....the feel of achievement is great.
Don't forget to carry own water bottles and do start early ...may be 8 am or so...so that u r comfortably back to start point by 12.
Don't miss waterfall point on return

Toilets are there only at start point near parking. And no toilet enroute.

The place is around one hour and 40 mins from Shillong in normal traffic.

Don't carry or wear heavy winter clothing as u climb ...same r going to come off and u have to carry it seperately

Enjoy ur trip",,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPL8ZK05p47sJZSs7MWRia5gZZsY6gfBfpAX4Hz=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110258436222287469328?hl=en-US,trek,,,,,,,,,"https://www.google.com/maps/search/meghalaya+places+to+visit/@25.4477479,91.2600632,10z/data=!4m2!2m1!6e1?hl=en",,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO5mrzjAHr5Grb8WkQcEv2vDhFBfo1L9LFLTHw2=w150-h150-k-no-p,False,,"The bamboo bridges are an absolute marvel. In the middle of nowhere, bamboo bridges built by the villagers take you right to the top of the mawrynkhang rock. A moderate to high trek- people who are not used to trekking might find it difficult to complete. There is a waterfall on the way, nice to take a dip there. Quite safe during summer. Per khasi belief, the rock is King Mawynkhang's head. Strangely, the rock does resemble a huge human face. Definitely a must watch. You need to reach Wahken village and take the trek from there. Better to start in the morning.

I've seen crystal clear natural pools like this in lots of other countries, but the amazing, beautiful, and weird rock formations still make this one special. And there are good places to swim in the beautiful water too (not right at the edge of the falls - see below).

The trail starts from a hundred meters or so outside the gate of the waterfall viewpoint. I was told that I still needed to buy a 50rs entry ticket for the trek (separate from the viewpoint ticket), though no one checked my ticket at the trailhead. It's only for people who are in reasonably good physical shape. The trail has three sections - an easy stroll along a small road along the top of the plateau, a steep and rigorous trail down a forested slope (and back up again later), and then a barely-marked route along the riverbed to the top of the falls. On that last section there are white arrows painted in some places to show you the recommended way, but I sometimes couldn't find them, and had to find my own way a couple times (very carefully - there are plenty of places to fall to your death, including lots of holes in the rock that are much, much deeper than you would expect). From the bottom of the forested slope there are also red arrows pointing the way upstream to another mini-waterfall.

The best place to swim is in a huge, swimming-pool sized pool of clear water just before you start to see the edge of the waterfall (it should be safe as long as the water isn't high enough to be rushing out from the downstream end, though you do need good swimming skills, as it's quite deep - and cold).",,4,2023-03-14T19:45:23.130Z,,,,,2023-03-02T17:48:24.425Z,People also search for,Lyngksiar Falls,,,6,,,,trek,,,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMaGa1rWrDgJiq73uW6bnPb5vstgwVMhMXKal7w=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMmsmJDZyYjtt9v0dmWkh_NQkF4GmhkDspDXlVv=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPRSg5dd7dDeblyyk4bdwrEQ7BFg8DX3O4WmQwW=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,Nohkalikai Falls View point,,,1550,,5,,,220,,,Cherrapunji,,,,,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOxVUKLl33DuuGxgyaX5W13pVkAf3-uTuRREVNx=w150-h150-k-no-p,64,,,,,,,,11,,,,,,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com › articleshow,,4.6,2723,,,IN,,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoOUxpMEx3EAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x2308a377eb6d93a4!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDh9Li0Lw%7CCgwI6MKDoAYQ2JzvygE%7C?hl=en-US,,,False,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOJjRle-N8ofLFwN8HTTZfMcOdXadbgrw1hzDjx=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,,,,71,"Nohkalikai Falls, located about 7.5 km from Cherrapunji‎ (Sohra) in the East Khasi Hills District of Meghalaya, is the most dramatic and tallest ...",,,,,,,,,,Tourist attraction,,1240,People also search for,,,,Rainbow Falls,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOHkVnGP_emcfGMNW_Tymkqi3F13wXLNRQ3vpyt=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNTpLUoTeEyW70POwE2raMsyK25iBjSeO1rNSgv=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,Nohkalikai Falls - Tragically Beautiful Waterfall in Meghalaya,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,plunge pool,,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Nohkalikai+waterfalls+Top/@25.27595,91.6865801,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x37508d4d6923699d:0x2308a377eb6d93a4!8m2!3d25.27595!4d91.6865801!16s%2Fg%2F11ddzrhz12?hl=en",There's no to we timing.

The hike down is not too bad, the path is well made and properly maintained. The view on the way are gorgeous!

Once you reach the waterfall, the turquoise blue water is simply mesmerizing!

We were not planning on swimming, but when we saw the water, we decided to hike back to parking to pick up our swimming clothes.

You have to wear a life jacket if you want to get into the water, it is mandatory. I guess even if you know how to swim well, they have to charge you for the life jacket and also make sure nothing happens to you.

The water was really cold, we could not stay more than 10-15 minutes. But it was enough to enjoy the refreshing turquoise blue water. It is so clear and calm - simply amazing 🤩

They have changing rooms and bathrooms you can use.

We felt so refreshed after swimming, it was simply amazing.

I would definitely recommend you visiting this waterfall, any time of the year it is good, I guess. We were there in the first week of March and even then the water was fresh, clear and pleasant (for short time).

Take the detour and make a few hours on your itinerary to enjoy this wonderful waterfall, you will definitely not regret it!👌",,5,2023-03-14T19:45:33.243Z,,,,,2023-03-05T15:45:31.311Z,People also search for,Tyrshi Falls,,,15,,,,swim,,,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPKTw161JoruOgODHzEmMk-xH35EorLZxnRPsTP=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,Moopun Falls,,,136,,5,,,3,,,Umlārem,,,,,,,,,,,173,,,,,,,,25,,,,,,https://www.holidify.com › pages › krang-suri...,,5,5851,,,IN,,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoc3V6QldBEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x184d09cd6d4df62a!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDhsuzBWA%7CCgwIm_KSoAYQ0MfPlAE%7C?hl=en-US,,,False,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMrSQSFpN5kN6Xmye13x69TE05jfDilt3ds49B4=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,,,,43,"Meghalaya is home to many mesmerising waterfalls, of which the Krang Shuri waterfall, located in West Jaintia Hills, is the most magical.",,,,,,,,,,Tourist attraction,,62,People also search for,,,,Krang Suri Boating,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNc93yUoEutlZWRxlqxrHGEWiGFkWvHGrf1DfbO=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,,,,,,,,"Krang Shuri Waterfalls, Meghalaya - Kolkata - LBB",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,trek,,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Krang+Shuri+Falls/@25.2874924,92.1257671,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x37506bd8df949e73:0x184d09cd6d4df62a!8m2!3d25.2874924!4d92.1257671!16s%2Fg%2F11ry3hx018?hl=en","It's 50 rupee for an adult

With huge crowd it definitely felt overrated place but when got to explore with lesser crowd found that this village actually has a vibe and is a good place!

If you are staying in this village for a night do make sure you don't book in advance and only go and book there. You'll find the same place at half the rates. Also, make sure to go on forest trail around the village it's actually beautiful and peaceful!

Also, only bad thing about this village is the food options. There are literally close to zero food options so do make sure you carry food with you with you are coming here and don't except you'll find it here.","I was missed the old website how can I got that website

This place is like a gated community which used to be an erstwhile originally well maintained village now mostly converted into Home Stays giving out living experience in their community.

Awesomely well maintained and self sustained village. Inhabitants are friendly, they also have a market area to showcase and sell their native products.

Recommended to visit for all...it is an experience in itself and we should be proud and take away some learning from there.

Visitors to Umngot River are treated to breathtaking views of crystal-clear waters that reflect the lush greenery and towering cliffs that surround it. The river is also known for its unique feature of changing colors, which is a result of the varying depths of the water and the sunlight that hits it at different angles throughout the day.

Tourists can enjoy a variety of activities on the river, such as boating, fishing, and swimming. The boat rides, in particular, are a must-do activity, where visitors can float along the tranquil waters and take in the stunning scenery around them.

One thing to note is that Umngot River is located in a remote area, and it may take some effort to get there. However, the journey is definitely worth it, as the river is truly a hidden gem that offers a peaceful escape from the hustle and bustle of city life.

Overall, if you're looking for a unique and unforgettable experience in India, a visit to Umngot River should definitely be on your bucket list.",,5,2023-03-14T19:48:16.046Z,,,,,2023-03-06T19:36:31.066Z,People also search for,Dawki Bridge,,,6,,,,boating,,,,,,2 days ago,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNcHYRqCRIXv1Lrno5sG9EDB-F8h35vX9-70C6s=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMexpQgL_FcGMgvcPyIwrH7RU4NHm7qvii9UztO=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,Darrang Umngot River Capmsite,,,1303,,5,,,88,,,Dawki,,,,,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPApQh-QSW8pCjQIkXzIzxScELuRZISo4Xx8IZy=w150-h150-k-no-p,37,,,,,,,,7,,,,,,https://www.outlookindia.com › see › story › t...,,4.8,4061,,,IN,,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoOU5xeEFnEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x231c30b6bed28863!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDh9NqxAg%7CCgsIv4GZoAYQuKTvHw%7C?hl=en-US,,,False,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOoSb69-A5pWwwu74di17oSMNtDvhPYcK-JvVdq=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,,,,290,"The Umngot River, or Dawki River as it is popularly known, is in the border town of Dawki, and is said to be one of the cleanest rivers that you ...",,,,,,,,,,Tourist attraction,,37,People also search for,,,,Dawki river,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMQB0mdY1iMEHexpQpsJUb_c9_x7uzVitjW7bIc=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPh54RhjAGkDwzFQL6vcivUksYgNyywcJqO9pMc=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,This Indian river is going viral for its crystal clear water,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,glass,,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Umngot+River/@25.1896044,92.0185179,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x3750433d367c876b:0x231c30b6bed28863!8m2!3d25.1896044!4d92.0185179!16s%2Fg%2F11ll9z0rv4?hl=en",Come and visit ,People also search for,,,True,,,,,,,,4.9,,,,,boat ride,,,Dawki boating,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Vaibhav,,,7,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipORbvwCptR8y2YbDWBKDRwR6ng-A80udvf6ldCl=w1920-h1080-k-no,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109594831436038470910?hl=en-US,,,,,,,,0,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPOX9ugXUlnLGtOEqSqSMSmGuw_ZsTvACaXTOLo=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM4FOxeWli0ovIu8LRS-CfLh4Y11O4-RDIzwhlT=w1920-h1080-k-no,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNEVR8cAXt6lvLyU1V4xJNGUy30zP1n1ceMpAUm=w150-h150-k-no-p,,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCMkktUmRREAE,,,,,,,,,,,,,16,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMj0qf7DhIAyyXcg6ObfEKhY71O4a5vqMH2jsUw=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMOfMlmYqoz4tlf3w2j81A5SjGN89BG7mavV9p8=w1920-h1080-k-no,,432,"https://www.google.com/maps/search/meghalaya+places+to+visit/@25.4482795,91.2600653,10z/data=!3m1!4b1?hl=en",41,2 months ago,,,,,0,,,,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103973386503490340634,,,"52Q9+RCR, Dawki Bridge, Dawki, Meghalaya 793109, India",https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMMeoNLzlBvSs1MiHONx9PyvLrVzyVgwlH-7L1-=w1920-h1080-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipORTYIEkFUQpp7PZtDDJYd_n9ODUv1BMK86Nfjp=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN6I1BUneD6XGrVyK8E2sRtyGSkzoDJPwVZLoc=w1920-h1080-k-no,People also search for,1460,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP1CT_N40XAKWpN2oWxFiJT_UQrr618BNYGRmSc=w1920-h1080-k-no,,scuba diving,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Local Guide,,,,,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com › articleshow,,,,,,,,True,,,river bed,,

Trekking shoes is must and pack your own food along, watercrossing is there first kia kayaking, and second via walking, i would say hire a guide to enjoy the view. 

Please note you have to walk through paddy fields and deep excavated coal mines be careful not child friendly, 
There are catterpillar everywhere, and paddy field snake so i strongly suggest to hire a guide, it will cost only 200rs, life's worth millions right.

We had Had gone from shillong. After seeing caves, eco park, seven sisters fall, we came here. It was nicely maintained. Better than eco park. More people are around. Mostly from nearby villages. More material for kids to play as well. Trimmed herbs. Someone is taking care of the same. Minimal ticket fee. Car🚗/taxi 🚖 Parking area outside was sufficient perhaps because of less crowded timing. A good place to hang out if you are staying in cherapunji. If you are coming from Shillong it is a disappointed place to visit as part of sightseeing. When we went there, ☁️ cloud played role of spoiler. Could not see the supposedly nice view off the cliff. Have seen other's pic in review. It is good. We were not lucky. In end December it was comfortable during the day. Must have been chilly at night. Nearby caves, Mawsamai caves are better attraction for tourists. This place is another 'also ticked/visited place ' in cherapunji. Photos come average in this location. Nothing much to eat nearby. We went to Jiva resort for food. Thay is good. Better pics come in the garden and decorative outside complex in that property. But any day this is a better place for visiting than ecopark. May be they will develop the later into an awesome place in near future. But as in end Dec 22, this place is superior to eco park.",What can go from Bangladesh?,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111857442548013885853?hl=en-US,beautiful,27,,0,,,,,,"https://www.google.com/maps/search/meghalaya+places+to+visit/@25.4477479,91.2600632,10z/data=!4m2!2m1!6e1?hl=en",,True,7,0,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN3IPXcYyawG5HNDfyglir4inRXZH5Kx0rWYzVK=w150-h150-k-no-p,True,10,"The park is lovely and peaceful.

This takes about 1-1.5 hrs of forest trail trekking to reach rainbow falls from double decker root bridge. It's tougher route than the double decker one as you don't have proper steps, it's mostly stone setup as steps and it's highs and lows throughout the route. You don't have to pack too many water bottles with you as it might be heavy to carry, also there are many shops on the way you can get a bottle or juice as needed. Absolutely unnecessary to pack for the entire trek. Carry a glucose pack each, it was life saver for us. Everytime you are tired, have a spoon or two it gives instant energy and you will magically have strength to cope for next 20-30 mins. There was a shop in the final location where we had some Maggie and snacks. I suggest you carry very minimal snacks like energy bars and some biscuits just in case you are hungry before reaching the place. There is restrooms available as well in some places. It was pretty manageable for us. It took us 1 to reach rainbow falls from double decker root bridge and return took us little less than an hour to return to double decker root bridge. From double decker root bridge to starting point of the trek took us 1.5 hrs and it was super difficult as it was very steep uphill. Also our guide said we were quite fast unlike other tourists. So please don't expect everyone to complete at this speed.

Guides are all over the place when you start the trek. Remember you don't need this. You need to pay 600 till double decker root bridge or 1000 till rainbow falls. The only confusion you will have is in the start where the steps are going up and one goes down on your left. Choose the steps that goes down on your left (this will take you to double decker) . Everything from there is pretty straight forward. There is no room to get lost whatsoever guide tells you. We hired guide because of the initial confusion. However I highly recommend you taking a guide if you have kids or heavy bags. Though they aren't helpful to guide you through the route, they can carry your bags and take pictures for you, they also carried kids. I'm sure that's quite useful that way. Regarding the sticks that people rent in the start of the trek, it's totally useless unless you have knee pain or elderly person who needs support to walk. Stick will also add weight and will be a hindrance to your speed it's much easier without stick. You always have rails to hold on to or you can sit on steps as you need to rest. Staying hydrated and going in steady pace is the key to finish the trek.",How far is it from Ancient Monolith of Cherrapunjee,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNPTXYCSjLpfHjCgi2s5vkT3xtcfMRxk8QLyWHX=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114897463564769462594?hl=en-US,trek,22,0,0,0,,,,,"https://www.google.com/maps/search/meghalaya+places+to+visit/@25.4477479,91.2600632,10z?hl=en",,,7,0,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMqP8YB1rDTwtA7fNlwb8yfX8o1UHwULWKqExPH=w150-h150-k-no-p,False,10,"This was a little farther from double root bridge, around 40 min hike. I saw beautiful blue and clean streams amidst the jungle which kept me motivated. For the longest there was no sign of the waterfall but thanks to a couple of strangers on the way who told me to continue. And man was it worth it! It was the most beautiful sight!! From the top one can just see the blue of water but go down and that's where the rainbow is visible from. It's very subtle but beautiful. Such pristine surroundings. It's breathtaking! Photos definitely don't do justice to the place!!!.
There is a maggi shop also to relax and eat and soak in the view.
You might feel tired at the end of the double root but this will absolutely refresh you. One can also take a dip in the water! So do do go!!
Also, would advise to get a hiking stick at the entrance.

of Caves is one of the best places to visit in Meghalaya. Lovely place to enjoy the nature Coming here you will find yourself very close to nature. There are so many different types of waterfalls here.  You will feel like seeing why we did not come here before and Here you will see a small waterfall in the shape of a heart.  All the people put coin in it and after that you will see the last spot, the last fall.  There is a small spring which has only one water flowing from inside the stone, it is also called medicine water. It was great because I have never visited such a place in my life.  This Garden of Case If anyone comes to Meghalaya must visit garden of caves. Parking space available you can reach easily.","Is it open all the days in a week?
