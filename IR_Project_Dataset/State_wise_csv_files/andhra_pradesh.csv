According to the myth, the Pandavas had come to this region during their  exile after visiting  Srisailam Mallikarjun temple and Dharmaraja Yudhishthir is believed to have installed the wooden lingam here.
SANGAMESHWARA temple was submerged in the water after the construction of the Srisailam  dam here in 1980. Unlike many other temples in this region, this temple was not relocated and it remained hidden under water for 20 years and resurfaced in the year 2003.
This is also called the hide and seek temple as it is visible for some  days when the water level is low during summer. Thousands of devotees visit the temple during these 40- 50 days in April- May. People are taken in boats as the temple is surrounded by water.
Several pooja's and rituals are performed for the wooden  lingam!  ''ARUNA HOMAM'' is performed for good health and prosperity. ''KALASARP DOSHA'' is also believed to be wiped away by performing  rituals here.
However this age old Temple is under threat because of the water surrounding it.
Shiva is one of the most interesting Gods  and  Shiva temples are found in the unlikeliest of places!
A sense of mystery revolving around these Shiva lingams strike a chord with our enthusiasm!
The SANGAMESHWARA TEMPLE is one such temple!   Sangameshwara temple or vijayeshwara temple a group of Monuments at pattadakal

Sangameshwara Temple is a Hindu Temple dedicated to Lord Shiva located in Pattadakal in Bagalkot District of Karnataka, India. This temple is part of Pattadakal Group of Monuments, an UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Temple complex is located on the west bank of the Malaprabha River. This temple has been dated to the mid-8th century by ASI. Sangameshwara Temple is also called the Vijayeshwara Temple.

It was commissioned by Chalukyan ruler Vijayaditya in the year 720 AD, but it seems the construction was never completed. The monument is a protected site under Indian law and is managed by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).

UNESCO has described Pattadakal as ""a harmonious blend of architectural forms from northern and southern India"" and an illustration of ""eclectic art"" at its height. The Hindu temples are generally dedicated to Shiva, but elements of Vaishnavism and Shaktism theology and legends are also featured.

The oldest temple at Pattadakal is the simple but massive Sangamesvara built by Vijayaditya Satyasraya (A.D. 697-733). The Mallikarjuna and the Virupaksha temples at Pattadakal, were built by two queens of Vikaramaditya II, to commemorate the victory of the Chalukyas over the Pallavas.

The temple's wooden Lingam, Sangameshwaram, is believed to have been installed by Dharmaraja, the eldest of the Pandavas, after their visit to Srisailam Mallikarjuna temple.[citation needed] The temple is considered a place of religious sanctity due to being built at the confluence of seven rivers and remain visible for two months.[3] (Bhavanasi, Krishna River and five rivers that merge into it beforehand, namely, Veni, Tunga, Bhadra, Bheemarathi and Malapaharini).",96,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNy-hkXjO7SKicjDyh4GlqdS0CJrIkOWsxwlyb7=w150-h150-k-no-p,,5,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPWHhuH95RTCrK5jKdy_H7DmO-YJC125tA68SRq=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,2023-03-14T11:21:51.721Z,37,16,,15,2022-11-23T01:30:24.244Z,People also search for,Someswara Swamy Temple,,,17,8,,,,,water level,,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AGNmyxZ0t8AAl1ZMpZdtQ8tU58pc55pnBk8OdRjBeJZz=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4-br100,3,,6,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNCyKng0tQUD4CuXFN5PRCRewtjKs6a0BnsOpKM=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,20,,,,Sangameshwara Temple,48,,13,,4,36,0,4,,0,2022-06-20T04:48:00.105Z,112542294808180655238,Nandikotkur,11,7,19,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMnt1nOhxRr37QjucloeFOJPMW1Cff19xwaTBf-=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,0,38,10,0,12,,,29,1,22,16,17,28,0,22,10,,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPcV83NVlBEAE,,0,,18,21,19,0,5,2795,,16,,IN,15,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPWAQSdie0PNQbb-E67IS9J6cwOa1d_HYy1_7fX=w150-h150-k-no-p,80,,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtak1faXhnRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x37034beacd135def!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgID-jM_ixgE%7CCgsIsO_1mwYQgIjCdA%7C?hl=en-US,,,False,17,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNOV3fqbcnKxMGuU8KeG2Jnp5pkLD9S0qurPORU=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,,,47,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN3r9c-4Cwa-s6wd77kHvIMqVlgKlvcnXwE2cX1=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPFZj0AotmPGgme6ZYkrdJQ4dhLFeOfvf9NC_Os=w150-h150-k-no-p,,8,0,,120,18,8,22,,9,,10,,,,19,Sunday,21,107361654685948855798,Tourist attraction,0,36,People also search for,2022-06-03T07:59:13.095Z,8,,"Lord shiva temple.

Presently, the 700 MW reversible hydro turbines (7 x 100 MW) located at the toe of Nagarjuna Sagar Dam are unable to operate in pumping mode due to non availability of tail pond for storing the released water during the power generation mode.
With the completion of tail pond, surplus electricity from the electricity grid would be used for pumping the water back to the Nagarjuna Sagar reservoir and recycled for meeting peaking load on daily basis.

Thus surplus electricity is consumed when it is available and used to meet the peak electricity requirements without letting the water out of the Nagarjuna Sagar tail pond. 700 MW peaking power for eight hours duration can be met from the one Tmcft of live storage water capacity available in the tail pond.",,,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102103145174187457950?hl=en-US,beautiful,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,"https://www.google.com/maps/search/andhra+pradesh+places+to+visit/@15.8434192,78.3308653,7z/data=!4m2!2m1!6e1?hl=en",,True,,,,,,,,,,Its difficult to reach the place.

Beautiful place. The story of Mallamma date backs to 14 the century. Mallama sits in deep penance praying for lord shiva. Pleased with her lord shiva appears in front of her seeing him tears of happiness roll down her eyes. Since then, tears of happiness keep rolling out even today hence the name mallama kaneeru. Next to her idol you can see lord Shiva's idol immersed in water which are her tears. Kaneeru in telugu means tears.

We went by jeep upto a certain point and then had to trek through difficult terrain to reach this holy spot. We  were simply overwhelmed to be there for this Deity is whom we pray to all the time . As children we have heard from our mother how Adivan SriSatakopan travelled from Kanchipuram  to this inaccessible terrain as directed by Narasimha in his dream and took sanyasa here. He saw not one but 9 Narasihmas here and did not know who would go with him when Malolan sat on his opened palms and directed him to travel from village to village and town to town and bless devotees. While we have to go to temples to see Perumal this Malolan comes close to our dwelling places with Azhaghiasingar and gives us a treat both visual and in the form of tasty prasadams. Yes there have been 46 Srimad Azhaghiasingars in the lineage beginning with Adivansrisatakopan . Malola aradhakars are called Azhaghiasingars and atleast three poojas happen daily at Sri Ahobila Muth .  When utsavar Malolan visits Ahobilam serthi sevai takes place that is Utsavar and Moolavar are worshipped together by Srimad Azhaghiasingar. Fortunate are those who can be present during the holy union. For the infirm and the old dolis are available. When one thinks of Nrisimhadeva who hid in every available space in the universe we realize the extent He goes for the sake of the devout. He is always behind us to guide and bless.It is indeed a blessing to be in Nallamalais in the ppresence of Narasimha and amidst the Chenchus who are untouched by the guile and cunning of city dwellers.,,0,,,Hindu temple,,,,12,,,,,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105869057108328766570?hl=en-US,,,,,Malola Narasimha swamy Temple,,People also search for,,4.7,,,,,,,,,,,,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP3RWf5KdPZBzTEUgpmNlFhB1hdBqaVRkqHmiH3=w1920-h1080-k-no,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHLU9LaEh3EAE,,,,,,,4,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtbE5HT2RREAE!2m1!1s0x0:0xdf4f50a1bb29f512!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICmlNGOdQ%7CCgsI_uv8jQYQ6PDrJA%7C?hl=en-US,andhra+pradesh+places+to+visit,True,,,,,,,,,,a year ago,,,,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AGNmyxZ0t8AAl1ZMpZdtQ8tU58pc55pnBk8OdRjBeJZz=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4-br100,,,,,,,ChIJQf1pHK30tDsREvUpu6FQT98,,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjejVmVkpnEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0xdf4f50a1bb29f512!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICcz5fVJg%7CCgwIla3cggYQ6IC0ngM%7C?hl=en-US,,108,,,2021-12-19T13:39:10.077Z,,4.8,,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104216422867021846267?hl=en-US,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO_SOxcJc5On0CBVQRW2ra6WrKaww6gJcbomn8a=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5RGF8t92XoJuHzhf70lnGVIdFsTME_w2q8dENhHiDs=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba8-br100,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMuYxJedz60MU9y1IUVrjF7JXgQZghPRme79h6-=w1920-h1080-k-no,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNjvjJSZPqMZ8QOpeKLZKnvSzGOBC3c6W5svyzB=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5QkqPAmZ320cnfXRL118n28Cdm3JT1MTSY7rhKuGg=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6-br100,,,"Malola Narasimhar Swamy is located on same hill of garudari hill, we visited this place after having the darshan of Jwala Narasimhar, this route is also tough,  there is no proper steps and path.

Nothing much there but a great weather, beautiful views and ample greenery. If you are looking for a relaxing 2-3 days break, go for it. Food options are limited as the whole place is managed by APTDC through their Haritha Resort so don't expect any luxury. The limited amenities include 1/ A small zoom maintained by Forest Departments, this also is house to Kalyani (the 160+ years old Eucalyptus tree) 2/ Freakout Adventures, a small adventure sports place managed by APTDC 3/ A message center and ofcouse the 4/ Restaurant & a bar. Food is not great neither, very presentable but taste is fine (Specially if you have a liking for Andhra Foods) like I do. Eat all you can at the buffet and there is some Ala-Carte items as well. In summary, fine for a day or two.It's very peaceful location and good for 1-2 days stay .sunrise and sunset worth watching .AP tourism hotel provides food and accomodation .Not sure if private accomodation facilities are there .If you are looking for a cozy and quite hill station for a day or two, this place is perfect getaway. From Bangalore, it is about 120 KMs and close to 25 KMs from Madanapalli. Though this place is small and doesn't have two many things to keep you engaged with lot of adventure or sightseeing but it definitely will give you option to enjoy the views from hill top, relax in a cool, serene location with a decent food and accommodation. You'll love the constant cool breeze and lovely view points in this place all through the day. What all do you need in a quite and scenic place surrounded by greenery. I have been to this place with my friends and then again with family along with other families. First and foremost thing, you must book your accommodation before you show up here. The best way to book your choice of accommodation is via APTDC site which will help you to chose rooms based on your need and their availability. Windfall Rooms with 4 beds were our favorites. Part of your accommodation booking, you get free buffet South Indian breakfast. However, you can always order for other items which is there in the restaurant menu.

Accommodation: These rooms, cottages, bungalows are maintained by AP Govt, Tourism Department and are pretty decent, clean and reasonably priced. You have hot water facility and generator back up. You can always ask for things that you might need and the staff are helpful as long as you are reasonable ;)

Fooding: In case, you don't want to opt for their dinner/lunch buffet, the staff can deliver the food in your accommodation as per what you chose from their restaurant menu. You can also get the raw material like chicken/mutton and tell them how you want them to cook it for you. Off course you have to manage some tips for the staff ;) but they were very reasonable. The staff associated with your accommodation will help you in most of the things. Apart from this, you have couple of restaurants, tuck shops/coffee shops around which are open until late night for any cravings.

Mini Zoo: This hill station has a mini zoo which you can visit with a nominal fee of 15 Rs per adult person.

View Points: There are 3 main view points available within very close vicinity of your accommodation. You can visit them during early morning or late afternoon to have a scenic view.

There are 2 goondas blocking the way. The display board clearly says rs.2 entrance but the goondas claim that to be for kids entrancr. In fact a rs.5 harathi ticket is issued but The priest inside ignores this , so he also aware of this fraud. Rs.5 from thousands of pilgrims daily is bad. Such extortion from poor people is condemnable.Why do they forcibly tie a thread and charge 10rs? Is this not looting? If they are going to charge money, they should put up a board( Thread for 10rs)Pujaris in this temple are very commercial and cunning. They are demanding for dakshina. They are tying 'tayattu' without asking and demanding 10rs/-. Very bad experience. Tirumala Devasthanam should look into this issue. Other than that temple is very good.

Sri Yaganti Uma Maheswara Temple
Kurnool, Andhra Pradesh

Agastya muni did Prathista of Uma Maheswara in Kurnool District. Temple is a wonder in many ways, Nandi here grows in size 1 inches every 20 years according to ASI. It is believed that no crows have been seen here in the cave temple as Agastya muni cursed them after being disturbed while in meditation.

Story says that Agastya muni wanted to build a temple for Venkateswara here. However the toe nail of the Vigraham broke while making and he couldn't do Prathista. Saddened by this Agastya muni did tapasya to Mahadev here.

Mahadev appeared & instructed to do Shiva Prathista as this place resembles Kailash. Agastya muni requested Shiva to give him a Vigraham. Mahadev gave him Uma Maheswara Vigraham, thus was Prathista done here.

Pushkarini, a small pond of water in temple premises, water is coming from Nandi's mouth but it's origin is not known. A beautiful cave temple which is filled with many wonders.

Still in good shape.
This temple was constructed by King Harihara Bukka Raya of the Sangama Dynasty of the Vijayanagara Empire in the 15th century. It was built according to Vaishnavaite traditions.

One story of the site's origin is as follows: The sage Agastya wanted to build a temple for Lord Venkateswara on this site. However, the statue that was made could not be installed as the toe nail of the idol got broken. The sage was upset over this and performed a penance for Shiva. When Shiva appeared, he said the place suits Shiva better as it resembles Kailash. Agastya then requested Shiva to give the devotees a Parvathi Goddess as Lord Uma Maheswara in a single stone, which Shiva obliged.

A second story is as follows: Chitteppa, a devotee of Shiva, was worshiping Shiva and Shiva appeared to him as a tiger. Chitteppa understood that it was Lord Shiva in tiger form, and shouted Neganti Shivanu ne kanti(meaning: I saw Shiva I saw), and danced with joy. There is a cave called Chitteppa nearby. Sri Yaganti Uma Maheswara Temple is one of the few temples patronized by one of the great dynasties of India. Every year Maha Shivaratri is celebrated and a large number of devotees from all over Andhra Pradesh visit. Shiva, Parvati and Nandi are the main deities in this temple. This temple is 14 km away from Banaganipalli in kurnool dt. The saint lord Veerabrahmendra swami stayed here for some time and wrote Kalagnanam.
The devotees believe that the Nandi idol in front of the temple is continuously increasing its size. The locals say that the idol was initially much smaller than its present size. They say that certain experimentation was carried out on this idol and it was said that the type of rock out of which the idol is carved has a growing or enlarging nature associated with it. Archaeological Survey of India has confirmed that the idol increases by 1 inch in every 20 years. Experiment suggests that the rock used to make the idol exhibits a growing nature.
feature of this temple is its Pushkarini, a small pond of water on the temple premises. Water flows into this Pushkarini from the bottom of hill through the mouth of a Nandi (bull). The water is fresh and sweet, as it comes from the hills.

Sri Yaganti Uma Maheswara Temple
Kurnool, Andhra Pradesh

Agastya muni did Prathista of Uma Maheswara in Kurnool District. Temple is a wonder in many ways, Nandi here grows in size 1 inches every 20 years according to ASI. It is believed that no crows have been seen here in the cave temple as Agastya muni cursed them after being disturbed while in meditation.

Story says that Agastya muni wanted to build a temple for Venkateswara here. However the toe nail of the Vigraham broke while making and he couldn't do Prathista. Saddened by this Agastya muni did tapasya to Mahadev here.

Mahadev appeared & instructed to do Shiva Prathista as this place resembles Kailash. Agastya muni requested Shiva to give him a Vigraham. Mahadev gave him Uma Maheswara Vigraham, thus was Prathista done here.

Pushkarini, a small pond of water in temple premises, water is coming from Nandi's mouth but it's origin is not known. A beautiful cave temple which is filled with many wonders.

The viewpoint offers a stunning view of the backwaters of the Krishna River, surrounded by hills and forests.

The viewpoint is well-maintained and the location is easily accessible, and there is ample parking space available.

The view from the Octopus View Point is breathtaking, with the river and its backwaters creating a serene and peaceful ambiance. The lush greenery of the surrounding hills and forests adds to the natural beauty of the location.

The Octopus View Point is an ideal spot for nature lovers and photographers. The viewpoint offers a perfect vantage point to capture stunning photographs of the river and the surrounding hills. It's also an excellent spot to relax and unwind, away from the hustle and bustle of the city.

Overall, I would highly recommend a visit to the Octopus View Point at Srisailam to anyone visiting the area. The natural beauty of the location and the peaceful ambiance make it an ideal spot to rejuvenate and connect with nature.",27,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO27S9f_zs3qJ5n3ZwVtnrPVzg9UrFgS7b6iHQ5=w150-h150-k-no-p,,4,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPSlGCm-sBTHwco-5JqbLOC_i9_zmvqLEOUgNqm=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,2023-03-14T11:32:15.401Z,100,17,,21,2023-03-01T18:02:48.887Z,People also search for,Siddi Ramappa Kolanu,,,,9,,,+91 73375 52033,,fee,,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5QeuGid929g6mMpeh52UDJvaGONlK4H1QX4n45iGQ=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3-br100,0,,7,,,a month ago,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMUenDXvoaAxuVWYpXyiBWClAv_t1cnKBZkqogr=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,21,,,,Srisailam Dam View Point,0,,470,,5,0,0,43,,0,2022-09-24T05:02:39.704Z,103012679184692873078,Srisailam,17,8,20,,,,0,13,11,82,0,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOJGTuWuJ3dNgj8_sh6zX9QhMCNO0VobOIzw5hC=w150-h150-k-no-p,,38,84,23,17,18,25,0,23,25,,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNlcS1HdUFREAE,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOpknX6wOhKwBnyhofyVAl__wCg1SGBqlGgoGml=w150-h150-k-no-p,0,,19,22,20,0,4.7,7334,,21,,IN,16,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPnEuBkawsdZG2ey2DR--F5xQzVTLW7A4UOh--M=w150-h150-k-no-p,76,,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocEtEczR3RRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x62648e7ff2ca8fd9!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDhpKDs4wE%7CCgwIyKb-nwYQ4I6xpwM%7C?hl=en-US,,,False,9,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMnkwNpqTbC7uMTbwaxIdqWcSbTx_NfaKhqIFcH=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,,,29,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNrzdBkREIJ9u48nKUxIlp7fIV-otczlcDXA9DM=w150-h150-k-no-p,,9,0,,87,19,2,23,,10,,16,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP-OuWjjEsG4XKlzzDpgmKFg9V5ZQM_ApCfpFm3=w150-h150-k-no-p,,20,Sunday,22,117430577005103689666,Tourist attraction,0,18,People also search for,2022-08-10T05:09:24.318Z,9,,"A must visit place if you are planning for Srisailam.

Srisailam Set amidst lush green surroundings, this historical town is famous for its ancient temples and invites pilgrims from all corners of India. Srisailam is counted as one of the 12 jyotirlingas and is also blessed to be a shaktipeeth (devotional shrine where the severed body parts of Goddess Sati fell), which make it a very popular spiritual spot. The Mallikarjuna Swamy Temple and the Bhramaramba Devi Temple are among the most famous temples in town and are thronged by a large number of devotees. Srisailam is also known for the Akka Mahadevi Caves, the Kadali Vanam Caves, the Srisailam Dam and the Srisailam Wildlife Sanctuary. While it requires one to take a boat ride on River Krishna to reach the amazing Akka Mahadevi Caves, reaching the Kadali Vanam Caves involves trekking for 12 km. The Srisailam Dam is visited by nature lovers for its breathtaking beauty. The Srisailam Wildlife Sanctuary, also known as Rajiv Gandhi Wildlife Sanctuary, is one of the largest tiger reserves in India and houses a wide variety of animals including blackbucks, sambars, panthers, spotted deer and sloth bears. Srisailam is located at a distance of 228 km from Amaravati and 217 km from Hyderabad.",0,11,,35,Hindu temple,41,21,5:30 AM to 9:30 PM,5308,,9,,,41,,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116835020120940895393?hl=en-US,50,20,,,Sri Bhramaramba Mallikarjuna Swamy Ammavarula Devasthanam,,People also search for,4,3.7,,31,,,,33,,17,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP7boq0QodKy_gVl7fIFcVEuPPaaOw9IB8LUFXb=w150-h150-k-no-p,19,631,Busier than usual,,6,,,70,Prakash Rao U B,,,5:30 AM to 9:30 PM,,13,40,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107545865620419525298,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOBReB_BGqSkch9VcUgYL39yA8hZnFKi4pCqp-x=w150-h150-k-no-p,,a month ago,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOTceI1gBKyFSM1F2ho84yd_YlZ8wo7pJyRgGwY=w1920-h1080-k-no,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1X01XLTJ3RRAB,41,14,,17,,4,147,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1NTlDdTRnRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x1875cd84b9c2e163!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICu59Cu4gE%7CCgsIwYSSmAYQgOXNZg%7C?hl=en-US,andhra+pradesh+places+to+visit,True,,,"3VF9+8F Srisailam, Andhra Pradesh, India",,22,,,19,9,6 months ago,,,0,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5SBk1nb58-dg0VNui9_rZrCadV-r8sPmNSw77PYIrI=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3-br100,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP1nr7g5LIoLlzkmq8kKInP6B-PIdvexC05uTkG=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,17,,ChIJ1TKvQWxltTsRY-HCuYTNdRg,,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNPc09INmt3RRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x1875cd84b9c2e163!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICOsOH6kwE%7CCgwI5LjTlAYQwKmXyAI%7C?hl=en-US,,42346,15,,2022-08-23T07:31:13.215Z,26,4.5,,8,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105881648806795129946?hl=en-US,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOIBgr4OMmwDkUh4oGgCJ33p86yVQz02O2Naryc=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5QQVIkdjX7xHAzLP3o2fvcqu7hgxcqZZ9SH0tTVYWg=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5-br100,20,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN9IHsiUa41608w8G6dh0yy8RaVSGqN05be9ZTA=w1920-h1080-k-no,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMtXhcBrq8vvCQ2xCXfpo4498v8U2nfAcriHGZF=w1920-h1080-k-no,29,,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AGNmyxbRKH6_OpiqEvrTLtuG1srunf91tjZMhVfD2xT9=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4-br100,37,26,"Really it amazing & beautiful place,i love this place, The best season to visit Srisailam is the winter season.

The demon king Hiranyakashyapu who was a Lord Vishnu hater turned extremely troublesome to his own son ‘Prahllada’. As Prahallada was a staunch devotee of Lord Vishnu and felt his presence everywhere he tried to kill his son in various ways such as throwing him in the sea, pushing him from the hilltop, tying him in a room full of snakes, leaving him stamped by a drugged elephant, etc. But Lord Vishnu saved him every time.

Once Prahallada advises and challenges his father regarding Lord Vishnu’s existence everywhere across the infinite universe, in every smallest particle of all living and nonliving things. Hearing this Hiranyakashipu points out to a lifeless pillar and asks his son if his Lord Vishnu is inside this dummy pillar. Prahllad says, yes he surely is. Hiranyakashipu then says if so I will kick this pillar and let me see if your Vishnu actually comes out or no. Also says to Prahllad that in case your Lord does not come out I will kill you by chopping off your head.

The calm and composed Prahllad as usual starts praying to the Lord. It was then the epic moment where the supreme God with rambunctious sound, tremendous aggravation, and barbarous exasperation bulldozes the pillar into pieces sounding like vociferous thundering and takes the avatar of man and lion and tears to open Hiranyakashipu with his lion nails and kills him. Lord Narashimha owns a human torso and lower body, with a lion head, face and claws absolutely terrorizing.

This very place where Lord Narasimha saved Prahllada and killed Hiranyakashipu is Ahobalim. And this very temple is the ‘Ahobila Narasimha Swamy Temple’ which is natural, the self-emerged idol of Lord Narasimha himself.",,Divyadesam Yeguva Sri Ahobila Narasimha Swamy Temple,,,18,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPGZsQoC-1cXf7fZ6hufVKURInreK9B1P_54ieD=w150-h150-k-no-p,,109431172685689525065,,17,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOKbBW3PTEqfJZYUFldwdWkil_WjhvyvbnYRcE1=w150-h150-k-no-p,0,15,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOEAhoq8EpQGgObSJnmqDhCEvaF4YgCn49sydCq=w150-h150-k-no-p,,11,15,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNjO_-BWGYmFdBFMVyScdvBjjWk3dBDrKX_Od9t=w150-h150-k-no-p,14,,,24,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP29uORz2L8dQYQl9ny4Bhxq4oi1zUPBwK0O19v=w1920-h1080-k-no,9,21,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN2iRJv-82cip8kL9pMN7hUWNEaGGSpB5P1I_Vj=w150-h150-k-no-p,32,17,,Saturday,,,5,,,9,11,18,15,11,17,8 months ago,,0,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPlTo9K9iuRA80_Z79cFxi9c-WVj_2AvY049MAx=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,21,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipON0-hch1cpaZqUJpwD0kUygp7yIlYY306i3hGZ=w150-h150-k-no-p,28,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOYWztexzi-ZwevqxTfJ6rSgyAESvZCJVzzxp41=w150-h150-k-no-p,68,swami,38,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Diguva+Ahobilam+Sri+Lakshmi+Narasimha+Swamy+Temple/@15.1338144,78.6725998,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x3bb4f545e10c2abb:0x22e9a51f02a5599!8m2!3d15.1338144!4d78.6725998!16s%2Fg%2F1tf_fvx0?hl=en","

You need to reach early to get there during the evenings. You need own transportation.

A  temple complex is designed and developed for Lord Vinayaka, Lord Nageshwara, Hymadevi and Amma Ansuyadevi. The whole complex is set amidst a large flower garden. Continuous rendation of her name happens 24*7. Positive Vibration is great, just feel it. What's most important is this is a people's temple, you are allowed into the sanctum to do  pooja on most occassion, the priest only assists you.

Amma left her earthly home in 1985 at age of 62.  She was no short of any saint, who are born to alliviate the humans from their miseries. First blessings was creating a regular source of food for humans and cattle. She herself cooked in the earliest days of her mission, as early as 1947....and as the people visiting her home for remedies grew,  she created the ""andarillu"" or everyone's home.

Her own daughter Hyma was concerted with sainthood when the latter passed away at a young age.  Amazing feats were performed to help people, one was in 1972-73 just after the Indo-Pak war, when she hosted a huge festival for 1,00,000 plus devotees, raising funds and help from across the state and outside.

This place is also having a Veda shala, Girls hostel, an old-age home, medical centre, Gou Shala and Oriental college.  Separate kitchen is available for Deeksha pooja.

Andarillu has a dining hall which can seat upto 200-230 for dining and about 400-450 in the first floor assembly hall. This andarillu can be utilised for marriage and other events. There are about 10 rooms in the mezzanine floor with toilets.  Andarillu is not charging commercially for the events.  Amma would never allow any one to go away without having food at her home, and same    principle is kept going even today by means of anna vitarana three  times a day,  prasadam is distributed to everyone who walks in, morning, noon and evening.

It's one of the best temples I have ever visited in my lifetime. The divinity and the peace at the temple pull me towards it every time. The temple is very pure with greenery everywhere.

Just get up early hire a taxi, because driving here is totally crazy, and too many accidents keep on happening regularly. Nothing to worry, all are minor accidents, like mostly involving car scratches and Bonet damages and all. Never a single life loss or anything similar. So with all this kind of risk this place is worth the pain. The waterfall from the dam looks so cool and shins like diamonds in the sunlight. You should feel it yourself because it can't be described by someone else, so pay a visit on your own and get to experience the beauty of this place. The serene and calmness around you is going to give you a higher peace and satisfaction at the end of the day. So give it a try on your own and understand on your own why I am saying such things. And remember to carry an umbrella with you while you visit this place. Because it's one of the important things you are going to need there.

The Google maps route was completely wrong and it took on the worst mud road which took 6 km from main road taking 30 mins and the other road which we saw after reaching the point which took us 10 mins to reach the main highway road.

The dam was very old structure and it looks very big and the maintenance of the park and dam was very good and a temple is also located next to the dam.

After Mahanandi, we left the place around 11.15am and reached Ahobilam base (after passing through Allagadda Municipality) by 1.30pm covering about a distance of 100kms by Tempo Traveller vehicle. This was our first visit to this place. This is a Hindu temple and the deity is Lord Narasimha Swamy. This place gets importance since it’s believed that the Lord descended to earth in Narasimha-avatar to kill the demon Hiranyakashipu to save his ardent child devotee, Prahlada in Treta yuga.

The place is picturesque in nature and has 2 Ahobilams; the Lower Ahobilam which has Prahladavarada Narasimha (blessing the child, Prahlada) as base temple and a Higher Ahobilam where the god is in a cave. Altogether, there are nine temples in the vicinity of 5kms depicting nine different forms of the Lord such as Jwala Narasimha, Ahobila Narasimha, Malola Narasimha, Kroda Narasimha, Kaaranja Narasimha, Bhargava Narasimha, Yogananda Narasimha, Chathravata Narasimha and Paavana Narasimha. It is believed that most of the temples were built in 8th century by Chalukyas and current structures were rebuilt by Vijaynagara Kings in 15th century. Only a few of these temples have easy access while most of them have to be reached by trekking through thick forest (known as Nallamalla forest) and rocky paths.

Base temple is under renovation and hence only ‘Utsavamoorthy’ is kept for visiting pilgrims. We had engaged an authorized guide from the main base temple and without the guide it’s very difficult to visit the temples. We were given a bamboo stick as a ‘climbing aid’. Through the help of Guide, we visited 4 temples in the vicinity. There are 450 steps to the last temple of the Higher Ahobilam called ‘Ahobaleswar’ which is ‘the temple’ of the place and it takes at least 3 hours to go and come back to the base temple. Further, it may be noted that all the temples will be closed by about 4.30pm so that the pilgrims as well as archakas (pooja performers) can return to the base before sun set.

Though there are concrete steps made at many stretches, you will have to pass through water streams over stones amidst green forest. Quite tricky & slippery at many places as well and thus it makes the journey – both climbing up & down, difficult. However, it’s very beautiful to walk through this serene stretch. I find climbing this hill is more difficult than climbing Tirumala hill. Therefore, one has to be physically strong enough to venture in to climbing from the base temple to Higher Ahobilam. After reaching the summit - “Ahobaleswar’, we felt completely relieved of the tiresome of climbing the hill! At this place, there is ‘raktha kundam’ - meaning reddish water pond – it’s believed that Lord after killing the demon, washed his hands and hence the water appears reddish even today (because of the reddish surface of the rock). But water is pristine and you are served this water and one can have this without any hesitation - it’s better than mineral water.

There’s food (annadanam) served free for visiting pilgrims through ‘Annadana Satrams’. In addition there are many small hotels & canteens. We were quite tired when we returned to the base after ‘trekking’ to the last temple but were lucky to get ‘prasadam’ at one of the Satrams at that odd hour.

On overall, it was joyous, fulfilling, adventurous trip and yet spiritualistic lifetime experience.",,0,,,Hiking area,,,,88,,,,,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111807617067191940586?hl=en-US,,,,,"Jwala Narasimha Swamy Temple,UPPER AHOBILAM",,People also search for,,4.8,,,,,,,,,,,,21,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113926257380023893270,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNprk8oqJAexS6mIrUgetDvAdXVBnpSPez8x_9f=w1920-h1080-k-no,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlaXBYVU5BEAE,,,,,,,13,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCb29uR1Z3EAE!2m1!1s0x0:0xbe2cb4916b050127!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDBoonGVw%7CCgwIuquOngYQkKXOrQE%7C?hl=en-US,andhra+pradesh+places+to+visit,True,,,,,,,,,,a month ago,,,,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5Q4kPdni9-Q73v4mvAvChsFBZJHPTRTE9zHDQ5I_2Q=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4-br100,,,,,,,ChIJs1jkG6v0tDsRJwEFa5G0LL4,,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN1M1pXVnpnRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0xbe2cb4916b050127!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICu3ZWVzgE%7CCgwIrOmtlwYQyMDp5gI%7C?hl=en-US,,815,,,2023-01-15T05:57:14.364Z,,4.7,,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107091331723563304572?hl=en-US,,,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AGNmyxbwK_EX8Bff5PyWr8vzR-1PnadWCFLQT6N1Lajs=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4-br100,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP-2V0IxRPSO4CtAw9UGLB6ipNjOPSmFmfHV3Nj=w1920-h1080-k-no,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMtuTieupWGXVz9mUtqPBRN2eKW3KUjygc88Sys=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AGNmyxaTgmvVXOh0Gh7dCQZ75tV2A3JP6zHNTKOJaPry=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100,,,"We joined as part of ISKCON organized spiritual yatra.

It is firmly believed the Lord Narasimha was 'Svayambhu' (self-manifest) here..
The all Nine Narasimhasthalas are self-manifest :- 1. Jwala Narasimha 2. Ahobilam Narasimha 3. Malola Narasimha 4. Kroda Narasimha 5. Karanja Narasimha 6. Bhargava Narasimha 7. Yogananda Narasimha 8. Chatravata Narasimha and 9.

Ghats of India, it's Godavari river 🏞️ which flows by. Visiting in the evening 🌆 is like awesome, you can just check out the pictures attached.

There's boating point too.

1. It's operated by AP government only.

2. You can visit there and they have 2 options fast boat ⛵ ( ₹500 per person in 2023) and normal boat 🚢 (₹ 70 in 2023).

3. We took tickets from the counter itself and was asked to wait for 10 to 15mins ⌛.

4. The good point in the boating was they don't wait for the boat 🚢 to be full may be it's because being operated by AP Gov tourism, we were like 12 members and boat capacity was 40+ but they just started the ride.

5. We can see two bridges 🌉 old and new both having railway tracks in and out, while going under them it was really good and saw trains 🚂 coming and going it's was scenic view 🪟, can see the pictures.

6. They'll take about 20mins ride and will drop you at the bank of the river 🏞️.

Worth visiting and please maintain the Ghat clean and clear it's our individual's duty.

At a distance of 1 km from Gandikota Bus Stop, Madhavaraya Temple is an ancient Hindu Temple situated inside the fort complex of Gandikota, Andhra Pradesh. Located in the west of Gandikota village, it is one of must visit in Gandikota.

Madhavaraya Temple is dedicated to Lord Vishnu and is believed to have been built during the reign of Sri Krishna Deva Raya of Vijayanagara Kingdom. This is the grandest structure in Gandikota or perhaps, in the entire region. The main deity from the sanctum sanctorum of the temple was shifted to Mydukuru after the Nizams finally broke the fort security. Though the sanctum sanctorum is empty but the ornately decorated mandapa is still intact.

The Madhavaraya temple displays a fascinating architecture with many sculptures of Hindu Gods and everyday rituals of common people carved on its pillars and walls. The five storey Madhavaraya temple tower dominates the skyline of Gandikota which can be seen from any edge of the town. It is an excellent display of art that has the life and culture of the lost kingdom preserved in its granite walls. One can see the carvings of fish and tortoise inside the temple entrance that acclaims the sanctuary was previously a holy place dedicated to Mahavishnu.

One can also visit Gandikota Jail situated near Madhavaraya Temple. It could have been the most dreaded building in Gandikota hundreds of years ago, today, except for one dark area of the jail infested with bats.

All the ancient artefacts available here are classified accordingly, and are well preserved.
An app was introduced so as to get the history of specific image upon capturing in camera. Some have animation videos as well.

Apart from Museum, Pingali Venkaiah Gallery where the then AICC  meetings were held in 1921, gives information about how the Indian flag was handed over. Marble sculpture of Indian freedom fighters who attended the meeting with their names tagged, is the standout of all. Inscription is also made so as to describe the events happened on 31 March - 1 April 1921.

Some inscriptions made on stones were left outside the museum. Probably, they might have thought to make a beautiful graden with these, but it turned out vague. Do not miss these outside sculpture area.

Most inscriptions and statues are from Penuganchiprolu and surroundings, Krishna dt. But, the history and significance of the artefacts are not mentioned anywhere which is a drawback.

Also plants communities like Ziziphus mauritiana, Cassia fistula, Acacia, Butea monosperma etc. are very useful for bird's nesting at Rollapadu.",,Cherukucherla,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOIFRGMcz24NzZJI9t0xqRQYAPnpTXGZJRGfWKo=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,116394693358776900828,,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOaORnn5YYnAFj3OqX2MjL5b8GTUl6NFMGngM29=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOm84CzGAehgz_BNjWC-suuUecEWwUyR_igivto=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMkMJVXFKV4Fhh0q9FS45CPmUUt8JSycLhmGYKR=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPvpF0dFdLYSCalHkcOZE8DAIw77gile6edQRkw=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,Saturday,,,,Shopping,,,,,,,,a year ago,,,,,1,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMyHSohLGu-pdjHIhjG0AsMx1L0ix2RFawWcFAJ=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,november,,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Rollapadu+Bird+Sanctuary/@15.7389773,78.3650976,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x3bb5b920d4865123:0xc246addbcba10492!8m2!3d15.7389773!4d78.3650976!16s%2Fm%2F0vxd6p4?hl=en",Migratory birds rarely seen and Deers commonly found.,People also search for,,,True,,,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQycTZpV1pREAE!2m1!1s0x0:0xc246addbcba10492!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgID2q6iWZQ%7CCgsIgNe3lAYQ2JKhdg%7C?hl=en-US,,,5,,,1,,,,forest,,,6,,a year ago,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMYsuKfqIvhjGpsCXj6OYv9nY3fNh7aGCWlnC55=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,Tuesday,,Lodging,,,,,HUNTERGAMEING,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPTsut_3hcJIA3ZyapcakJXyaMvkLx4DzUgnWVA=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,7,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNhcZokP9R9ESrGtPF8T_ABJZ-aVIgG244BKt8G=w1920-h1080-k-no,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112610241511466814169?hl=en-US,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMgLnlnhKIVw_BOO-YXcS05gNEDvG5WX3qaDEqI=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,,1,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPTBevHobW8PNpUnKKzwHC7j5b8GWX1r87cRSZS=w150-h150-k-no-p,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNTExWjA0zR4M4QmIhZfDpKYzDiMMLEPAoCFWvF=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOa8eWKFFV3iksBM9AK_XW8gUujjmF38Cj77eKA=w150-h150-k-no-p,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPZq6IhXgUliJ7pLodQxu_f_U5Xck7YptJeB4Am=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMb3wtxRRBaUJlKFWP40clbwK_utTOEVOZeozQo=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1MXNxZ01REAE,,,9 AM to 6:30 PM,,,,,,,,,,49,,,,,,9,,,,True,,,,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM-wG4sxAQQs58D8dvuvr4a0KwNhvYDkENjRizu=w150-h150-k-no-p,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPpIgNjnxZPavaKp6n7UliHKz6Pj-LD2YWG5_xD=w1920-h1080-k-no,,367,"https://www.google.com/maps/search/andhra+pradesh+places+to+visit/@15.8665289,78.3310078,7z/data=!3m1!4b1?hl=en",73,6 months ago,,,,,,,,3,,,,,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105509738156944914659,,4,,,"P9Q8+H2X, Rollapadu, Andhra Pradesh 518405, India",https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMF6fpW1-9lbPtwD8hvJluJVCQEOfITjZwSEmG3=w1920-h1080-k-no,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNd5q1erlAW5sVpwbI1EmCePep28XViot_pEmQ=w1920-h1080-k-no,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNtOUxXSEd3EAE,,,,True,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOyStkl6fpoa_bFdad8lTStjSAIN8ovihrPNfTt=w1920-h1080-k-no,People also search for,,9,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOfPEXgYGPkmcB_Yk5cUvQH_2xSG8CT3Ipoa1WO=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,migratory birds,,,,,,,,,,,9 AM to 6:30 PM,,,,,,,,,,,రోళ్ళపాడు పక్షుల అభయారణ్యము,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,vehicle,,,

You should plan your trip in such a way that you will be there by 11am to 12pm. Spend time checking out the  fort, temple, other monuments inside. Later go for a river boat ride. Check all booking in advance to save time . Then experience Sunset.  Plan for tent stay at river bed. Pre booking will save some money . Later in the morning see the sunrise and come back.

For adventure lovers this is a paradise. Do not miss going to this place . We went late so could only check the fort and sunset at the top of the canyon.  It was an amazing experience
Carry juices like paper boat and some chips as food backup since there is not many places to buy food nearby.

The Gandikota Gorge is a stunning natural wonder that is often compared to the Grand Canyon in the United States.

As we arrived at the site, we were immediately struck by the sheer scale and beauty of the gorge. The rocky cliffs towered above us, with the meandering Pennar River flowing far below. The view was simply breathtaking, with the changing colors of the sky adding to the natural beauty of the surroundings.

As we explored the area, we found several vantage points from where we could admire the gorge from different angles. The views from each vantage point were simply stunning, and we spent hours taking in the natural beauty of the surroundings.

The gorge is also home to several historic structures, including the Gandikota Fort, which dates back to the 13th century. The fort is a fascinating example of ancient Indian architecture, with massive walls and ramparts that have withstood the test of time.

The atmosphere at the Gandikota Gorge in the evening time was simply magical, with a sense of peace and tranquility pervading the surroundings. The cool breeze, the stunning views, and the company of good friends made for an unforgettable experience.",139,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP3mIYrYcXSuCq7H9g6X2I5yqQb6pGVb5RCh7ru=w150-h150-k-no-p,,4,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMzjyETFFARJu7Wlm9tddFC_Cjn1fNXhjyJzSIV=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,2023-03-14T11:50:38.086Z,32,15,1,19,2023-03-07T02:26:41.823Z,People also search for,Gandikota Canyon view point,,,1,16,1,,+91 89786 72152,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPzOQ_Tdr_oWJfgicec6jziCT0yYNNuC5Op2HdG=w150-h150-k-no-p,tent,1,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5SAf3xrz-lvHmB5GLM9NLioP0-XKvduJ4-mpaEKfP8=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5-br100,3,,5,1,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOuYWtQloDXxFNu7JrsRKNL6brPLBCK2si89LiP=w150-h150-k-no-p,,3,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPJGHzDWpgYw12GNjioZiiuLlPA1QZo1XX65d-r=w150-h150-k-no-p,,19,23,,5,GANDIKOTA TOURISM,1,,112,22,5,24,11,490,,3,2022-10-09T06:24:36.750Z,101449322296294778753,Gandikota,15,6,18,,,22,14,29,9,62,23,,,71,75,21,15,16,14,16,21,32,3,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURlMnJtR293RRAB,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNFslDuWfOdL0yCtZmPNGq3DWg5W6HOpPgva5dD=w150-h150-k-no-p,4,,17,20,18,1,4.7,10935,1,11,,IN,14,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNpw7mJyVn7VWiU1K3CBlg4-xQUug4j6mbAO0Sn=w150-h150-k-no-p,40,,3,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURodXB2Z1dnEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x265788567cd9f504!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDhupvgWg%7CCgwI4cGaoAYQ6K69iAM%7C?hl=en-US,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNTXZXXczpx6eeMH21GqGHKh6Bgb0dTKI56ik_w=w150-h150-k-no-p,False,10,1,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMHPAQRGeiho5BhT1tLDtEBiyRgt93q3GXVNmt-=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,,1,28,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPQd4bbQln409T99DoJWaIhoLavcKuynTTdT7zC=w150-h150-k-no-p,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipONoLfgbQuyUPfow9SDxGRx_kybTGGMT9SgqmfO=w150-h150-k-no-p,,7,1,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM4WRxOmqla7_O5oD2Sj4TBEtSv9k3POivc9m6s=w150-h150-k-no-p,24,17,2,21,,8,,14,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOdobZNp0F1QeoDX7C3LBG0NxCmsi6P0ioEWiWM=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP7iFZ_naXjadH0TDq9dQ7mx9Iat5YronsncE8g=w150-h150-k-no-p,,18,Sunday,20,106782452458011847845,Tourist attraction,1,922,People also search for,2022-08-15T14:08:13.894Z,7,,"Must visit place.

These caves are famous for Buddha sculptures and their historical relevance. While i found this place clean overall, it could have been maintained better (specially when there's paid ticket for visitors).

Kondapalli fort is one of the best places to visit in Andhra Pradesh. Located in krishna district. It takes almost 35 to 40 minutes to reach there by car. It's 25 km from Vijayawada.

Kondapalli is ruled by many king's and it was under many kingdoms. This fort is built on a hill in kondapalli and it's 11 kms to reach hill top from bottom of the hill. There is a small museum established by tourism department where we can know the history of the fort and the kings who ruled that place.

It took half day for us to cover the entire fort. There were some monkey roaming inside the fort. And a ticket of Rs.30/- is needed for an adult to enter the fort. And the fort guys don't allow any food items inside the fort.",https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNE9BeOsIrXxSgttM2iPmAwIH-gvTPs31K_-ISn=w150-h150-k-no-p,,0,,Fortress,en,,4 months ago,,13,Bijinapalli Trinadh,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOgIYBJAryBkBhGaPseAptHXzPzF0pTDbpwn2dM=w150-h150-k-no-p,Friday,,171,,,7,0,9,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMvl2Q03Oxx-AvsLCgFWF6QM3YiOJbb40_qUpIB=w1920-h1080-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOjBRA65wO8qfDTIivWOi5ay-NcQjgcBk7B5kUv=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMgqfYR7qAVP1HqO6XDug3XfJdyBlV2GhoXQsn5=w150-h150-k-no-p,,53,,,803,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMYU_Upx4MJfbybsto_9Vcv13uQtxF4ygzKhyNq=w150-h150-k-no-p,,0,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOHl7n77Mq7aUd1MNB87UA1QfNLIDQN6VZe7nyY=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,112501064620400669937,,,120,,,10,95,,89,,,,Kondapalli High peak,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOBXPz4Aiz1fzYDUZPCZDEkVitGWYF_BlXmMGQl=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMLJ8Y8doHB8aOW4idKKVbeFLl-vPd_Z0LI3T-M=w150-h150-k-no-p,,14,Andhra Pradesh,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNlFhkv3LjiZoU7IPbkj--5l5tdJK_vnNwX8cC-=w150-h150-k-no-p,9,8 AM to 5 PM,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipME1gP81O09gV_-WoZ6L0Jk4094aYduPWMUW337=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNPdp0MlSLR4qJ61IiosVa4QMIVSFrVE1plVfWq=w150-h150-k-no-p,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOW3LeHZ1JRNM0bqwohzsOIE_b_6ens58DuhERQ=w1920-h1080-k-no,,5,7,0,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURocUlYb1BBEAE,40,0,,23,0,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM9PULGSfKy9LNzjhxwBr8FohcagJ-RCaikNRjl=w150-h150-k-no-p,,Wednesday,0,,,Kondapalli Reserve Forest,Thursday,Monday,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOZN23gv2a6Kc2HuU9_2t2ce6zpzuys1X0NEXYs=w150-h150-k-no-p,16,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM6jPn3Panh-Nr-oTn3b8ga5vXs9uRAAF0O92dc=w150-h150-k-no-p,8,,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5TxdI4AWT5S1vDYMB7Pg0Ntp5Cuo2PK-Q1BPiw0bA8=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5-br100,,,,29,False,14,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMguHXCQK0ljrEz3RNvbSbDrT7NKGtszg-1UVNB=w1920-h1080-k-no,3,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPErP1L7_4NGi_fMA6MEZ-28jW2HnBHrnc_M_va=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP_pOcrLglTPMOk4r5NwfEJqk-h3QVAWHWXWGds=w150-h150-k-no-p,app,7,27,,18,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP1T9Dn_btPcrLHPV22rneiQpvz6xShv1POvCZn=w150-h150-k-no-p,5 years ago,25,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMUv_lUG9o0rMxxtgyxMFxZ6bs0sNLe3cxLSmFO=w150-h150-k-no-p,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPrDVLk4VNt_YBqeexArca4UgzRNTyRLV_kK12q=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNZx-zu_qbcoNzrvHqMlH6y2GuBMdjuKsf9ESpW=w150-h150-k-no-p,0,"JGGJ+57C, Ghat Road",35,,,,30,2022-10-05T03:08:18.151Z,0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109888900172555160292?hl=en-US,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNlnd7x1a_RfjZS1iq8oyp6igEMrpdfVWCXEP99=w150-h150-k-no-p,0,16,22,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMBnAnmaBLD0V1I91_AAl-4bcEa04BSjEut6hW-=w1920-h1080-k-no,,8 AM to 5 PM,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP0Hw11vLdULsAn0pHYzkTu0YXncPAy4TK3jog6=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,0,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNSGPW1LfqW0g34rLFzIXNbywKhbL0NjHe1BKod=w150-h150-k-no-p,4,,,,0,40,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM0B1OojuJUycC1mvuzHpUmpL70RRfL51eOnCp8=w150-h150-k-no-p,A small tourism spot on top of a cliff.

Padmapuram Gardens is one of the prominent places to visit in Araku Valley. It was built in 1942 for growing and supplying vegetables to World War II soldiers. Later it was converted into a Horticultural Nursery cum training center. The 26-acre nursery comprises orchards, a colorful riot of flowers, a fabulous rose garden, exotic plants, trees like eucalyptus, pine, etc.

The striking feature of the Padmapuram Botanical Gardens is the tree-top huts. Also known as hanging cottages, they are 10 ft above the ground level and have attached toilets and continuous water supply. Visitors can stay & experience the thrill of swaying in the air when a heavy wind blows across. This Garden also features a toy train by name Araku Express. Araku Express takes adults (Rs. 20) and children (Rs. 10) on the tour of the whole botanical garden

The Padmapuram Gardens is known to be a favourite spot among many tourists who visit Araku Valley. Boasting variety of species of flora, the garden is home to an exquisite rose garden, treetop huts and a fun toy train for rides around it.",,Is it open at this month,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOK5h5YDqDqSDFFd9jEJIPHoqHgy_bKyNOYyi--=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112989329835351005167?hl=en-US,toy train,27,0,0,0,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMKtRfCp1Gi4sXqXDCKlI3aM1ec8f2-X4Zcd6HA=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMQf9LZ-ohWwGJH2LHaHTs9xYmQx_z7Ww7CpimS=w150-h150-k-no-p,3,"https://www.google.com/maps/search/andhra+pradesh+places+to+visit/@15.8434192,78.3308653,7z/data=!4m2!2m1!6e1?hl=en",,True,7,80,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNhwhz7_l9xv9RWXkWnNuBy63XK_51v4EpH2NHc=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMPiZc7zb8_pQDKIZQ2iJxzo5pg1c90_1Auw_pB=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMp9FHsgDRN297X1hV9oPSg_vo8z_30zz7XklNj=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN0anxgCcky0m_W92LjohwZOZdanuFD1pTszMGJ=w150-h150-k-no-p,True,10,,"Need to more care...

The waterfall is situated in the middle of a dense forest and is a popular tourist destination in the region.

The waterfall is formed by the Kapila River which originates in the nearby hills. The water cascades down a height of about 100 feet into a small pond at the bottom, creating a stunning sight. The pool at the bottom is also a popular spot for tourists to take a dip and relax.

Kapila Teertham is also considered a sacred site by many Hindus and is believed to have mythological significance. According to legend, the sage Kapila performed penance at this spot, and the waterfall is named after him. Many pilgrims visit the waterfall to take a holy dip in the pool and offer prayers at the nearby temple.

The best time to visit Kapila Teertham is during the monsoon season (July to October), when the waterfall is at its full flow and the surrounding forest is lush green. However, it's important to exercise caution while visiting during the monsoon season, as the roads leading to the waterfall can be slippery and dangerous.

Overall, Kapila Teertham is a must-visit destination for nature lovers, adventure enthusiasts, and spiritual seekers alike.",,"(Translated by Google) Present water unnaya

Eat well and empty your bladders before going visiting this place.
As there are no toilets anywhere near.
Only one small tiffin center serving idly.

There a lot of souvenir shops selling local herbs, plants and fruits.

If you are going as tourist then avoid it.

But, if you are visiting for religious purpose then it's very important site and one of the five mut visit places in Srisailam for devotees.

Don't go there unless you are either religious or young and absolutely bored.

Even there's continuos inflow of devotees there's not even a single tpilet for ladies or gents.

There's a staircase of 150 steps that you need to climb down to get to the small stream and climbing up is a challenge as each step is a bit higher than usual.",,Siddi Ramappa Kolanu,,,,,,117064537941070776931,,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOdsf9WUyq4vP5EAiiaW47wG9IytGYXoQemc-5S=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPXsPRdwKPCnOp3vjpan47OWalYme-6yPXOPt8t=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3 months ago,,,,,,,,,,,,tapas,,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Paladhara-Panchadhara/@16.0532486,78.8910292,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x3bb56f7db36ffa75:0x8c02224d09532151!8m2!3d16.0532486!4d78.8910292!16s%2Fg%2F1tnjh03v?hl=en",Evening time,People also search for,,,True,,,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtOWNXU0R3EAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x8c02224d09532151!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgID-9cWSDw%7CCgwIuqa7nAYQ0M3ZkAE%7C?hl=en-US,,,4.5,,,,,,,lord shiva,,,0,,3 months ago,,Good place with water fall.Shankaracharya performed tapasya here n small temple is there.,,,,,,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOzlge52fA1yaWmFJ7SJ-qfbud543eD-8QL227x=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,,,Prudhvi kumar Bevara,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPh_tdeF3kQxwnq0iUw8NBar8Kaax87lIjwJxhU=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,18,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNGCejohUbg7-7FKAAOFo3DPJCeMn7QUXSEDMjJ=w1920-h1080-k-no,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115219134514673905822?hl=en-US,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNxLgQ5Z5KmEeaRScgwrLbu6sgFSdMvP8sydjrv=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,,0,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPpK4q1uCAsw_d9W9N4ptkMuOU3YCG5mEX8lfJE=w150-h150-k-no-p,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMHXZF5BgOXDmdPWcjbW98X-61sTgnB1yI1kfaP=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNHdSrNOKlzYfOnm8FhnucsMDrkzGKlHIV5k__5=w150-h150-k-no-p,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPjlfQHSIPtNk3YpWRLlczcCGt1Rv8D9Q3ysdma=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPU6NiM4TaxA6mnxrGLA1d7hJ4H1L5k59xTQNFC=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNCdmUyS0l3EAE,,,,,,,,,,,,,136,,,,,,,,,,True,,,,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOdo0iUdNbdaC5QvoZn0lYwI0ZmIyOrr1-4zufv=w150-h150-k-no-p,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP91w1RuS_HgSmvSRxqITKere5BmNo0lPMnPF_q=w1920-h1080-k-no,,3487,"https://www.google.com/maps/search/andhra+pradesh+places+to+visit/@15.8665289,78.3310078,7z/data=!3m1!4b1?hl=en",14,2 months ago,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108752035168154929139,,5,,,"3V3R+7CR, Road, Srisailam, Andhra Pradesh 518101, India",https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO-q0v7G4KBXPy7teBJRI6kciVTMwlHDG8t4Ady=w1920-h1080-k-no,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipORYlt_OqeB9UKlEWZ5m7nXxFo8Xopez7rBTW9g=w1920-h1080-k-no,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtX00yUDBRRRAB,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP6V2fathV3MsbdanwFeig_xWYB1iGg8ym970Qc=w1920-h1080-k-no,People also search for,,42327,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMRgx1wTxXGs3OMByLVW3U1hBO8EjpLGl25ZBVd=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,penance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,27 reviews,,,పాలధార-పంచధార జలపాతం,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,,herbs,,,

It is managed by ASI and DSLRs have an additional fee. There are 2 main structures, the kings palace which has been converted to a museum and queens palace which is a relatively smaller building which you cant enter or climb onto the upper floor as the doors are locked. There is a small pond in front of the kings palace and garden area surrounding it. Toilet amenities are available inside the fort area but not sure how clean they are.
There is a pathway that leads to what could have been an awesome trek to the top of the hill that overlooks the palace but it is closed and there is an ASI guard who will shoo you away from there :).
The museum displays various artifacts ranging from statues to weapons to documents etc but nothing that gives you that wow factor. Photography inside the museum is prohibited.
Not too far from the village, so you dont have to worry about refreshments and you also have cart vendors who pitch their stalls outside the fort in case you want to grab a quick drink.

Located in the outskirts of the city and below a hill, where it meets the sea, this lighthouse was inaugurated by Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri, the then minister for transport and communication in the year 1953. This has been opened to the public for visits however one needs to first register the visit with the armed naval guards with a govt approved ID card and also need to pay a ₹10 for the entry ticket. You will be asked to shoe your bags for checking in case you are carrying one. The climb to the very top is through a narrow stairwell with the final approach is by a steel ladder. The optical glass at the very top is made in Paris, France and is visible, embossed on the side to the keen eyed. The lighthouse is still functional and is maintained by Directorate of Lighthouses and Lightships under Govt of India.

Tribal life since their birth to death as the museum portrays all stages of the tribal people since the ages with their statue type of human beings and farming, animal loving and how they preserve the nature , family traditions and customs, food habits etc.
It was displayed photos also.
It has shopping complex of local handicrafts toys and other wooden,jute products to buy .
Prices are on higher side.
Entrance ticket also high.
Children can enjoy as packaged game are available.
Nice display of local site seeing pics.
Food restaurant complex available inside the museum.
Still can improve a lot as one can understand lot of commercial interests are there instead of travellers or tourist interests are ignoring as i personally experienced.
Anyway all can enjoy.",,Will this be closed on 18/3/22 for holi?,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOVp1sAJIrtMDDiuKf3pU7IxKJeYUlRUalD2CKo=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111169764594257171357?hl=en-US,tribes,50,0,0,0,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNOg3yMjnrrlOVCJsfycYFLUjkXbS_Jc4sHWa4o=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,,4,"https://www.google.com/maps/search/andhra+pradesh+places+to+visit/@15.8434192,78.3308653,7z?hl=en",,True,7,100,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNJ6pOWuzGNelwHmXcH2KS-ZlnTfN8UD3cRVx-L=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPp_6US0OMofKb7UesxQR9ZqTzbEK6y42nnggAw=w150-h150-k-no-p,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN4n_Qx4J20w8lpjGuP9epHX6d9UIs6fq9R0vvs=w150-h150-k-no-p,True,10,,"It is one of the acclaimed places to visit in Araku Valley. Araku Tribal Museum is located in the small town of Araku, around 110 km of Visakhapatnam. Unlike other museums, which house historical items, the Tribal Museum showcases the artifacts from tribal life. The 2 storey Tribal building is built using the traditional indigenous materials such as mud, metals, etc and showcases native tribal architecture in the form of colors, motifs, and frames used.

The first floor of the red-colored rotund structure displays dioramas depicting tribal lifestyle, day-to-day kitchen utensils made of iron and mud, musical instruments, and wall paintings of market scenes and clay pottery. It exhibits local tribal dances of Mayur and Dhimsa from a range of festivals and life-sized figurines wearing vibrant clothing with matching accessories. The walls adorn the masks, and exotic artifacts belonging to the Tribal culture of Eastern Ghats. The second floor houses a souvenir shop and the Tribal Arts and Craft center. The center also houses 10 double rooms, public conveniences, and a cafeteria.

Location: Araku, Andhra Pradesh, India

Price: Entry Charges – Adults- Rs. 40, Kids – Rs.20.

Timing: 10:00 a.m. – 05:00 p.m.

Best Time to Visit: October: March is considered the best time to visit Araku Tribal Museum, though the climate throughout the year remains pleasant and balmy.

In the end, things turned out well for me this time around, and I had some wonderful diverse experiences. (with the assistance of a native guide)

This 10–13 kilometre long trekking paradise requires an entire day to complete. Make sure you have everything planned out, and get an early start. In this challenging trek route, there are no manmade pathways, so novice hikers would be best served by engaging the services of a local guide. You run the risk of becoming disoriented and adrift in the middle. You can find many helpful guides in your area by doing a search on Google for that topic. There is not any food available at that location. You have the option of obtaining food packages from either the town of Uthukottai or Nagalapuram.

It is possible to place a group order for food in advance with the local guide or with the small vendor located in the East end parking lot. Bring along enough food, water, a camera, a flashlight, and a swim tube (for non-swimmers).

Parking is available at the Eastside entrance of the building. In the beginning, a portion of the flat terrain invited us with its mysterious character. The path was then traversed by a number of smaller streams. We revitalised our spirits by swimming in the refreshing pools of water and took pleasure in strolling through the beautiful terrain of the hills.

Each of the three water pools will captivate us with its own special allure and distinction. With a fish spa or pedicure in the pool, you can experience nature at its purest and most relaxing. Wear footwear that is appropriate for the terrain, as most of the trails on the trek are slick. Return to the parking location well before the sun goes down, and adjust your return time accordingly.

Due to the treacherous and exciting nature of the trek route, you should exercise extreme caution at all times. When possible, stay away from people of advanced age. While we were making our way back in the evening, the rain began to fall more steadily, and the experience of walking through the dark forest while it was raining was both thrilling and enjoyable. One of the more memorable walks I've taken. observed that only a few groups had stopped to set up their tents for camping. Camping in this location will provide more excitement and adventure than any other activity. I owe it to myself to do so on my subsequent hike to Nagala.

It is not recommended to go as a solo or female trekker, and it is preferable to complete this trek with a group of people who share your interests so that you can get closer to nature. Be prepared for the fact that there is virtually no mobile network coverage in the hilltop area.

Many thanks go out to Mari-Arai, a local guide who showed us all three pools and ensured our safe return in the rain and darkness of evening.",,,,,Tourist attraction,,,3 months ago,,,Anandha Vasan,,Friday,,13,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNtOOlciQ3atpoWWwAxPrnf9jGzneHw4G0u0Tf_=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPH01IrlunlKUbPjPIj_SRhBc9GQ5pP6Q4WE-lS=w1920-h1080-k-no,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP9wWhpVMHIP_HBWtvxRaW9ZezrBBhF_B0xuVNE=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,81,,,,,,,108624815456683532794,,,20,,,,,,,,,,Tada Waterfalls,,,,,Andhra Pradesh,,,,8 AM to 3 PM,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOLEltBRp73mp8f5vJtj3nYSEzrzuTmvJ4_Vqts=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,10,,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNocUpmRDN3RRAB,40,,,,,,,Wednesday,,,,T.

These pools are spread out across a number of different levels. Because there are so many monkeys, you need to be careful with your belongings, particularly your food. You also have the option to camp at the base, which is also where the trek begins. Do return back before it gets too dark. Maintain a supply of both food and water on you at all times. During the daytime hours, those camping at the location can purchase coconut waters and various fruits from the local people. After a short distance of walking, you will arrive at the water stream.
