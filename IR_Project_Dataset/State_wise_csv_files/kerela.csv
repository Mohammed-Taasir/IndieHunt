There is an Anna daanam in the temple oottupura, mostly in the morning and to a small scale in the afternoon.
The temple is lively with large crowds milling about on yhebriver side. After lunch the place becomes deserted.
The temple has a few rooms on hire for devotees, but vegetarian food availability is very minimal. Even in Kuttippuram it is difficult to get vegetarian food. Tirur has a Ganesh Bhavan, but how long it is open in the night, I don't know.

The church was located near Marari beach, but the expansive size of the building and the surrounding grounds meant that it was never too crowded or noisy.

Its a perfect place to sit and reflect, with plenty of quiet corners and peaceful spaces to choose from. The church itself was also very well-maintained and clean, with comfortable seating and beautiful architectural features.

One of the things I appreciated most about this church was that it not crowded. While I'm sure it can get quite busy during major holidays, I found it to be a refreshing change from the more crowded and noisy churches I've visited in the past.

Overall, I would highly recommend this church to anyone looking to escape the hustle and bustle of daily life and find a little bit of tranquility.",,,,arrows,,,,16,,,75,56,Arthunkal - Wikipedia,,28,,8,14,20,january 10,,,,17,14,,Wednesday,,,,0,4.6,Thursday,1,,12,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPb9ushD4qNIAdygMw6uF49ztVuQyDZdtq5WkCW=w150-h150-k-no-p,16,10,10,,,Monday,7,,9,,,,17,,,4.7,,,114,3,6,14,,25,,16,31,35,,"Arthunkal, Cherthala South, Kerala 688530, India",,17861,10,6,False,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOeBpfhatlIR8fEtVyJpScN_XQJht_VLVU6XDhq=w1920-h1080-k-no,8,6,6,Arthunkal Junction,,,,,14,,,40,2023-03-16T15:23:13.816Z,16,,"സെന്റ് ആന്‍ഡ്രൂസ് ബസിലിക്ക, അർത്തുങ്കൽ",9,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/St.+Andrew's+Basilica,+Arthunkal/@9.6611287,76.3002896,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x3b087d1bd160539b:0x2c1c33d951bdf38f!8m2!3d9.6611287!4d76.3002896!16s%2Fm%2F0nb2jtw?hl=en",https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMmUJDUke4xAWFqttLzgKo_Y0dgUaNovcciVx46=w150-h150-k-no-p,15,19,17,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNy1eOoNc-Fj8Oq8txMZqSDnEpQPXUzWKMiFY6w=w1920-h1080-k-no,,13,21,,31,17,1,19,ChIJm1Ng0Rt9CDsRj_O9UdkzHCw,,2 months ago,parvathy b,,11,2023-01-16T16:52:18.276Z,5,19,People also search for,18,,19,17,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM468Th48FxBrQIm-Nz_swswvS4UIeWaFu00yZw=w1920-h1080-k-no,,25,7,,,,44,5,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102258002840734203783?hl=en-US,18,,,St.Andrew's Basilica Cemetery,15,12,,,5,0,,34,14,True,21,,,,False,160,Tourist attraction,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNSBRSDB1jDtiRjLbuKvcv5lPrsRxNmnmd54gk6=w1920-h1080-k-no,8,,5 AM to 9:30 PM,4,,,,,4,"Must watch!!!

He was sitting in a chair, as soon as I asked him he stood up with a very pleasant smile and brief me everything with a very calm and soft voice with a very pleasant smile.

There's parking space available in the entrance area for a parking fee of ₹25 for four wheeler vehicles. There are many shops available on the way to the pine forest.

Things to note...
1. Those who plan to visit Chakkipara on a 4 wheeler, will have to walk/trek for around 3-4 kms (Cant recollect the exact distance)
2. 2 wheelers can reach the top but there is not much parking space.
3. Google map will not take you to the exact location, you will have to travel more. There is a small board with a map at the location where google map shows you have reached the destination. Follow that.

The view from the top is beautiful but there is no shade once the sun is out.

It was an enjoyable experience for us all and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a great outdoor experience.,13,0,Parks,36,,,12,,0,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOyNSXmsOVL7HIleMRuW3u5UiL36hsr9U7_rjdp=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,,,8,0,47,,2 months ago,,,Kerala,8,0

Overall, I would highly recommend a visit to Chimmini Dam for anyone looking to experience the natural beauty of the area. Whether you are interested in hiking, birdwatching, or simply taking in the views, Chimmini Dam is a must-see destination. The entry charges to the dam are 20Rs per person and 50Rs per bike. We will only get BSNL signal. Once you reach the dam, you may get free wifi based on the electricity.

Don't expect too much as it appears in cinema.  Just like a heritage house with bigger courtyard and rooms. Murals on the walls are beautiful.  Pond besides is huge and clean. Better to visit on weekdays since it gets busier on weekeds. A truly nostalgic place. While we walk through the Mana scores of classic Malayalam movies will flash through our memories. Really sad that it is not properly maintained. Preferably visit during weekdays early morning by 9.00 am as the place will almost be empty.

Forest officials may take action against you if found violating the rules. Warning signs have been explicitly placed at least at some spots narrating the accidents occurred. This is for the safety of the visitors. There are many locations where you don't need specific permissions. And for some, you won't get permission anyway.

Please also note that as you go deeper, you'll find leeches. Keep moving in densely vegetated areas. Do not stand at one place for more than a few seconds. Keep handy a little amount of salt or snuff (മൂക്കിപൊടി) or tobacco leaves (പുകയില) & apply on the leech if it is on your body. If you're bitten, do not pull it forcefully to remove it or you might end up losing blood. Use shoes for a safer walk, though leeches can get on quicker & inside the clothes than you might think. When you're out of the jungle check socks & clothes.

Stay safe.",https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNO_S9xqB4UQ5kJtvFJUWISH_Fpr7WtDlPrB4l-=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,221,,,,,11,,,,,,,4.4,FJ5X+G8P,,False,,,,,,,78,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,825,,,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMK5OIsM9xAw4KzSFVOp3_YY4r8-GHCb7OIz-kR=w1920-h1080-k-no,,People also search for,,678508,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPl6MBdLbXRTRtuiy9Okl_JND15ciMPARoZGWTC=w1920-h1080-k-no,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5TJUbLmOIfF89JtW2dlDR3E7vhsP-ZmLi6B8gX0nA=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4-br100,,,,,,"Casual Subreddit for India. ...

Even though it is small in size and very few animals are here, it is a good option for taking kids on a holiday.

The best thing is we can visit it even during the noon time as there are enough trees to protect us from the sunlight.

It is always crowded with visitors, especially kids. We will find it difficult to park our four wheelers since there is no particular arrangement for the same. We have to park our cars on the roadside.

Ticket rates are cheap and there is a family ticket for Rs. 40 which permits a family of four. An individual adult ticket costs Rs. 20 per person.

Animals are less in number , but there is a park inside for kids which they can enjoy very much.

The ticket is Rs 20 per person and you can leave the vehicle near the ticket counter. Then you have to go down some steps to reach the waterfall area. I saw some couples hiking upwards through the rocks too. But one can only hike up few steps.
There are separate washrooms built for boys and girls, which are clean. We were the only ones who took a bath under the waterfall and everyone was staring us. So, I am of the view that not many people take baths here. Benches are made for you to sit down and enjoy the view.

Located in the picturesque Western Ghats of India, Mattupetty Dam is a must-visit destination for any traveler to Kerala. During my recent visit to the area, I was fortunate enough to spend an afternoon at this stunning location, and it was an unforgettable experience.

One of the first things I noticed about Mattupetty Dam was the breathtaking natural beauty that surrounded it. The dam is set against a stunning backdrop of lush green hills, and the cool, clear waters of the lake provided a soothing respite from the hot Indian sun.

The dam itself is an impressive feat of engineering, with a length of 1,700 meters and a height of 170 meters. It was built in the 1940s to provide water for the surrounding towns and villages, and it remains an important source of irrigation to this day.

One of the highlights of my visit to Mattupetty Dam was taking a leisurely boat ride on the tranquil waters of the lake. The boat ride allowed me to soak in the natural beauty of the area and provided a unique perspective on the dam and surrounding landscape. The cool breeze that swept over the lake was refreshing and invigorating, and I felt completely at peace surrounded by such stunning natural beauty.

Another highlight of my visit was the opportunity to see some of the local wildlife up close. The surrounding hills are home to a variety of flora and fauna, and I was lucky enough to spot some deer and wild goats grazing on the hillsides.

For those looking to learn more about the history and significance of the dam, there is also a small museum on site that provides an informative overview of the dam's construction and the important role it plays in the region.

Overall, my visit to Mattupetty Dam was a truly memorable experience that allowed me to connect with nature and appreciate the beauty of the Western Ghats. Whether you're interested in engineering, history, or simply looking for a peaceful retreat in the midst of stunning natural beauty, Mattupetty Dam is a destination not to be missed.Nice place.

If this was well maintained by the authorities, perhaps this would have been a nice place but the reality is a bit different.

• 𝐓𝐢𝐜𝐤𝐞𝐭 𝐏𝐫𝐢𝐜𝐞 🎫
For Adults its 10/-

• 𝐓𝐨𝐢𝐥𝐞𝐭𝐬 🚻
I did see some toilets signs inside.

• 𝐏𝐚𝐫𝐤𝐢𝐧𝐠 🅿️
There is no designated parking area but on a normal day, you can park along the road without any trouble.

Even Buses can be parked on the side.

• 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐟𝐟 👩‍💼
Only saw one staff who was selling the tickets. She was quite pleasant.

• 𝐁𝐢𝐫𝐝𝐬 🐦
I didn't see any birds but I did see alot of bats hanging from a tall tree (look up from the ticket counter, above the building)

• 𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐈 𝐟𝐞𝐥𝐭
This place is not at all maintained properly.
The routes are not marked. You dont know where to go and where not to go.
There is no map to show us the area.

The decoration items (statues of animals & birds) are almost all destroyed or in ruins.

10 rupees is a low price for a tourist spot but even that is not worth it (if you are coming for sightseeing).

Instead of calling it a Bird Sanctuary, maybe its better we call it a Couples Sanctuary because I didn't see any birds but I did see couples on each and every bench 😂

In the end thats all this is. It's a place people go to sit and talk with their lovers.

Such a Nice place to relax and chill. Easy Trekking Location for beginners as it is more of Flat.

We reached the place around 10PM and stayed at 1Km distance from the spot. The rooms are really very cheap. They charged only 750 for four people. The only issue is the availability of Food. You have to either carry or have it before starting the hill ride which is 15km down from the main spot. As we reached there at night, we carried items like bread and dry fruits & nuts for our breakfast.

The vehicle entry gateway will be opened at 8AM, whereas we can walk through the pathway and reach the hilltop. And we need to get our entry ticket while returning. Otherwise we have to wait till the gate opens and get our entry ticket. Vehicles are allowed only till the parking place which is 2km away from the spot, and there is a Jeep facility available from the parking place to the hilltop which is optional.

After reaching the park you need to take one of their bus to travel to the top and that is also not to the very top. It's a long walk from there and certainly not for elderly people.
