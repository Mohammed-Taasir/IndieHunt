The cleanlinesses is to be rated very highly. The management, the staff, the system are very well managed. Appreciative work done by Bihar Govt and Bihar Tourism Department. I do appreciate the Bihar Govt. But one I did not like was the Ticket Price as Entry Ticket was of 150rs. As I went there I had to purchase a Seperate Ticket for the Glass Bridge which was also of 150rs per person. There was a very big waiting line from the bottom of the mountain to the Top and had to wait more than 1hr. Else everything was Good.

so superb place that we were not in the mood to come out from the safari. Place is full of natural beauties, place is very neat and clean.
Ambience is superb
While going there, there would be an entry free of Rs. 100 and for bust service Rs. 150 will be extra paid. But don't worry, you won't regret to pay the amount.

Waiting lounge is also there with food and water service. History of earth you will see as a movie if you want to.
The guide out there are also very friendly and humorous. You will love their services.

Overall that was a superb experience.  A Must visit place.",,"(Translated by Google) Safari zoo has opened

We booked our tickets online, payment was successful but tickets were not received. So again we had to buy the tickets from the counter. The safari park is an absolute delight to the eyes as it's surrounded by hills, beautiful flower gardens. The place is huge and it's really impossible to get around the whole park or do all the activities in a single day. Another flaw was that there were no proper instructions given anywhere so people tends to get confused what to do or where to go. Otherwise it's great boost to Bihar tourism. The place is full of fun activities such as cycling, boating, rock climbing, riffle shooting, archery, etc. But all the activities have separate tickets.

Best place for bird's migration. Here boating is available at 50rs per person and entry fee for the Bird sanctuary is 5 RS per person. This place is little bit affected with excessive human interface in future because it not developing as or according to birds habitat. It's is developing as tourist attractions which quite good for areas growth but not good for bird's.
Overall this is haven for bird's. And best place for people who want to know and see the international birds at hugh number.
It's a humble request to all who is going to visit here is to maintain silance and don't do anything which affects the bird's life.",,"Nagi Dame kitna lamba hai

The Sabhyata Dwar is built with a Mauryan-style architecture with a purpose to show the ancient glory of Pataliputra and traditions and culture of the state of Bihar. The monument was first envisioned by the former Lieutenant General Srinivas Kumar Sinha. The 32 metres high structure is taller than Gateway of India by 6 metres and was built at a cost of ₹ 50 million. The monument is spread over an area of one acre within the campus of Samrat Ashok International Convention Centre. The arches of the Dwar contain inscriptions attributed to Megasthenes, Ashoka, Buddha and Mahavira. Atop the arch monument is a small stupa upon which rests Ashoka's four-sided lion capital made from alloyed metal. The northern and southern faces of the arches contain inscriptions attributed to Megasthenes, Ashoka, Buddha and Mahavira. Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar inaugurated the monument on 21 May 2018.
The idea for constructing a Gateway of India like structure was pitched by the former Jammu and Kashmir Governor Retired Lieutenant General Srinivas Kumar Sinha (SK Sinha) in 2010. SK Sinha suggested the idea to build a Sabhyata Dwar (Civilisation Gate) near the residence of City Superintendent of Police on the banks of River Ganga to show how the river port of Pataliputra attracted people from across the world. On 8 February 2014, foundation stone of Samrat Ashok International Convention Centre was laid by the then Chief Minister of Bihar Nitish Kumar of which the Sabhyata Dwar was a part of. On 21 May 2018, Sabhyata Dwar was inaugurated by the Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar. The Sabhyata Dwar is built on an area of one acre within the campus of Samrat Ashok International Convention Centre, north of Gandhi Maidan. The Dwar faces Ganga on its northern side.",,How many tickets charge,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104432953879816596080?hl=en-US,gate,52,0,0,0,,,,,,"https://www.google.com/maps/search/bihar+places+to+visit/@25.5303527,82.7734237,7z/data=!4m2!2m1!6e1?hl=en",,True,7,0,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNiL23VKKnELotkXrG1jyrioB6_3M9VexFot4FS=w150-h150-k-no-p,True,10,"You don't have to pay any entry fee .

There is no washroom for  visitors .

The security of the park is in the hand of private firm .their man do their work with full sincerity .

From time to time many historians came to this mountain and gave different theories about the origin of the temples built here.

It is believed that there were 52 temples initially but some of them got demolished over time and some by the invaders.

Now there are about 5-6 temples left in good condition. One can still find so many ruins of temples and other structures all over the mountain.

The main temple of Umga called the Sun Temple is still standing in a dilapidated condition following the rules of the Nagara style.

As per the first inscription discovered by Markham Kittoe in 1847 the main Umga temple was built in 1496 by Bhairavendra. But the other ruins and idols indicate that it's way older than we think.

There is a temple in a U-shaped cave 500 meters from the main Umga temple, known as the Umangeshwari cave temple. The deity Umangeshwari is believed that represents pre-Aryan tradition.

Some historians also believe that the Umga was a factory where temples were made by rock-cut techniques. One can still find the rocks dispersed all over the mountain containing archaeological proof.",,"Will the temple open tomorrow.

Temple trust or the local body govt started  renovation work, City is known by this temple so it must be taken care in such a way but it lacks such care. There is problem of parking there, so use taxis or 3-wheeler auto or horse driven chariots could be used.
You can get Prasad from outside Shops.
People are very genuine & helpful here!

Initially when thought to visit the temple, didn't know that the temple was the Shaktipeeth. But later found the place is a SHAKTIPEETH where Devi sati's left thigh was fallen.

Since the temple is located inside the city and the temple is not famous as other shaktipeeth temples, that's the reason there was not crowd at all except only 7-10 people.

But now the temple trust is trying to expand the temple, so the efforts are in progress.

Request all Hindu brothers and sisters to contribute to the expansion of the temple.

Whenever, you go to Patna, it's a must visit place.",,"(Translated by Google) Seeing a very beautiful beautiful scene, it seemed as if the mother had appeared.

Buddha Relic Stupa, enshrining one of the eight parts of the mortal remains of Lord Buddha after he attained Mahaparinirvana, is one of the most revered sites for Buddhists and a protected one for Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), located around 55km northwest of Patna in Vaishali district.

The Buddha Relic Stupa was built by Lichhavis as a mud-stupa in the 5th century BC. The stupa was later discovered in an archaeological excavation carried out under the aegis of Patna-based K.P. Jayaswal Research Institute during 1958-1962.

Yet, ASI, with all resources at its command, presents a museum that is underwhelming. Of course one is glad that there exists a museum. But ASI needs to learn from museums elsewhere how to display and exhibit priceless artifacts.

When I visited, one of the galleries with the railings was under repair. You could still walk around but workers were at work and some artifacts had been removed from their positions. I am not sure that there was adequate precaution against damage to the objects while the repair was on.

At any rate, what was a little unsatisfactory to me was the indifferent nature of the cataloging and the labels. They were the bare minimum. ""Buddha - Bhumisparsha mudra - 9-10 CE etc.""

Some more informational displays, some more background could have been immensely helpful. What is the importance of the building material used, which styles of architecture and sculpture are there and what are the key features.

What is the significance of statues of Prajñaparamita and Nairatmaya Buddha? Is it Bhairava or Mahakala?
What do the Ashokan Brahmi dedicatory inscriptions say?

With past illustrious ASI members such as Dr Debala Mitra and HD Sankalia having written about Bodh Gaya etc, the current ASI can at least emulate their scholarship and present a more well-researched exhibition of these priceless objects.

I was lucky I requested for some sort of book/booklet at the ticket counter on my way out. And they gave me the small brochure whose photos I have attached. Such information should be available to all visitors. Bodh-Gaya is an international destination. The ASI has a great opportunity to put forth a professional exhibition and showcase the treasures of that region.

Timings - 9AM - 5PM

** Since I was foolish - and impatient - for more information I bought a book titled The Art of Bodhgaya from amazon by who else but a former ASI official. A glossy, well produced book, it has all the information about the objects in the museum at least! Esp the railings. So the information is our there - just that ASI does not think it fit for the common people I guess!
From further reading of a variety of sources I gathered that a lot of the art and sculpture is of the Pala period - late 8th to 12th CE? The Bhumisparsha mudra images and the prajña images are typical of that period. The Brahmi lettering are often donative.

It was built by Maharaja of Darbhanga, Rameshwar Singh. It had originally 11 temples of gods and goddesses. It had several forts and palaces.
But all this structures got damaged by Bihar-Nepal Earthquake during 1934.
Tajmahal has 15 layers of carving but in these structures there are 22 layers of carvings. Ivory and white marble which is used for ""Kali Mata's Murti"" is similar to Tajmahal.
The cemented structures of Four Elephants looks phenomenal and it is said to be first cement structures of India.
But all these goodness are just in vein. Government left this place to degrade even more. It was never repaired by anyone. Locals here are continously demanding it to be turned into a tourist site from government. But you know they are busy looting public money. This place is also suffering from encroachment. The grass field in front of the structure is logged heavily with rain water.
The temple outside of the SSB Camp's gate is in good condition because it is being taken care by them. They renovated it by their personal fund.
Let's see when government is going to give it a look and decides to renovate it and declare it as a tourist place.
But anyways, these structures are worth to see one time and appreciable.",,"(Translated by Google) Will the palace open on January 1, 2022?

However, the region has been inhabited by humans since time immemorial. It is located on the banks of the river Ganga and is mainly noted as the birthplace of the legendary Hindi poet, Ramdhari Singh 'Dinkar'. As it is home to several ancient sites, it is of historical significance. In the past, the region was a significant part of the Mithila kingdom.  My birthplace is this, so being a resident of the district invite you to visit this newly recognised Ramsar site of bihar.

One such place which makes it a weekend getaway for numerous tourists is the beautiful Kanwar Lake Bird Sanctuary. This wonderful sanctuary is one of the greenest parts in the region and certainly defines the natural beauty of the state.

The park is well-maintained and beautifully designed, with lush greenery and a serene atmosphere. It's truly awe-inspiring and a great place for quiet contemplation.

In addition to the Buddha statue, there are also several other attractions in the park, including a Stupa and a Museum. The park is a great place to relax and find some peace and quiet, while the whole park is a beautiful spot for a leisurely stroll.

Overall, I would highly recommend Buddha Park to anyone visiting Patna. It's a peaceful and beautiful oasis in the midst of the city, and a great place to experience the tranquility and wisdom of Buddha's teachings.",,4,2023-03-15T12:00:08.273Z,53,17,,21,2023-02-17T18:56:35.544Z,People also search for,S K Puri Park,,,51,,,,lord buddha,,0,7,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOlJMur9Yvnt0rrcW716wibHySsEoZ6dhdouAS9=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,21,,,BSPHCL Energy Park,0,Park,14649,,5,72,921,0,,0,Patna,17,8,20,,0,11,,39,63,,,449,54,23,17,18,54,0,23,97,,0,,19,22,20,https://www.myvisitinghours.org › bud...,4.4,0,53959,,70,IN,16,,82,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoeGF2RFBnEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x7dc52c62fffa32a2!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIChxavDPg%7CCgwI45u_nwYQ4IrUgwI%7C?hl=en-US,,,False,24,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMtRZj91aBQ_BWozcbipCI1NYd4Y5LHXcA4zibR=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,,,0,,108,The Buddha Smriti Park was developed by the Government of Bihar to commemorate the 2554th birthday of Lord Buddha.,19,23,,10,16,,20,Sunday,22,Tourist attraction,0,44914,People also search for,9,,,Eco Park,,,19,,,18,,0,14,,78,44,,,37,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMeakdor5eFLXaIsZaHUF--nr6W_0NFRMBeNoL-=w1920-h1080-k-no,63,22,,18,,Saturday,,,6,,Buddha Smriti Park in Patna - Bihar Tourism,75,12,19,25,12,18,,,0,,,,,,ashoka,82,0,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Budhha+Smriti+Park/@25.606782,85.137389,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x39ed58429528a9f1:0x7dc52c62fffa32a2!8m2!3d25.606782!4d85.137389!16s%2Fm%2F0wblz4t?hl=en","Of-course,,,, as you wish,,,
