It is one of the unique places to visit in Jalandhar because of the devotees who come here offer toy aeroplanes to the deity. The deity in this shrine is of Baba Nihal Singh who was a local in Talhan.

Baba helped his fellow villagers in various things and later years after his death, a shrine was built by Harnam Singh, one of his devotees. The story behind offering toy aeroplanes is that the devotees wish they could fly in an aeroplane someday. As per the temple authorities, around 50-60 planes are offered in a week.

Location: Talhan, Jalandhar, Punjab.

And I can't really disagree with them. This place is located at the banks of Ranjit sagar lake. This place provides a great view of Ranjit sagar lake and at the backdrop you can see the Mighty Dauladhar Range. The rainy season should be the best season to visit this place with greenery everywhere and blue water. Our schedule was tight but there are many spots within a few km of radius to spot some great locations.

French architect, Monsieur M Manteaux who designed the mosque had also designed the Jagatjit Palace in the city. The masjid is reminiscent of similar structures in Morocco and Alhambra, with colour schemes and design elements that seem more like in Seville in Spain, than in Punjab.

Maharajah Jagatjit Singh was a ruler with extravagant tastes known for the developmental activities in the then Kapurthala State. He was renowned for his secular credentials. The Maharaja, a Sikh, who built it, believed in catering to the aspirations of his largely Muslim subjects (about 60%). The mosque was his ambitious effort to promote social integration among his people, and this is proved by the fact that when the then Viceroy of India sent him a letter questioning him on the large costs involved in building it, the Maharaja replied: ""Your Excellency may be unaware that 60 per cent of my population comprises of my loyal Muslim subjects. It is only in the fitness of things that the best place of worship in my state be constructed for them.""",,,Other,,,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPLy5sIcnlzMvMElpqJ-GmaUTgU2AnXrGS8_Tm-=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,,,,,,a month ago,,Punjab,,

Many wild animals can be found in the area. There are many water and bird species. Dinosaur park is good which contains models of different dinosaurs which move a little bit. There is a separate place for big birds which is quite amazing as birds are free to move in that particular area. Reptile house is good but there are less species.

But today all over the world this environment is being poisoned in a number of ways. The constant more in the world population is the main reason for environmental pollution. More population means more industry. Factories release toxic gases into the air, and filthy poisonous waters from factories and mills For also released into the waters of rivers; trees are cut down for fuel and other commercial purposes, or for procuring land for building houses.

This results in a fall in the supply of oxygen that the trees provide With the felling of trees animals and birds also lose their shelter and this destroys the balance in the ecology. Human beings suffer from various kinds of diseases like asthma, hypertension, different kinds of heart trouble, bronchitis, pleurisy, etc.

Sound or noise pollution, especially in the cities, is caused by the hooting of cars and buses, and playing music over the loudspeakers also subjects people to another kind of environmental pollution. To prevent these hazards from endangering human, animal, and plant life measures should be taken before the situation goes out of control. More trees should be planted.
