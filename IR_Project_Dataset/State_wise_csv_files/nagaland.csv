It has a area of 861.95 sq km with elevation ranging from 100 to 2000m. Pakke has more than 1500 species of plants, 40 species of mammals, over 371 species of birds, 36 reptiles and 30 amphibian speccies, 360 and 360 identified butterfly and moth species respectively. Pakke is a paradise for watching hornbills. There are four species of hornbills found in Pakke. Great, Wreathed, Oriental Pied and Rufous- necked.
When we visited Pakke we saw that this completely untouched forest. This is a good news to all of us that Pakke is still in the state of pure forest. There is no any human influence or modification. During the trip we interacted with the officials who work there, visited into the forest for birdwatching, to see the artificial hornbill nests that are planted during the nest adaptation programme,2016. There were so many birds that I have encountered for the first time.
There is a centre of Bear rehabilitation. When we interacted with Dr. Pranjit Basumatary sir who work for bear rehabilitation, we got to know so many new things about wild rescue, how they handle it, how they release these rescued bear, how we can be familiar with the animals call as well as other rescued animals.
In the reserve we met Mr. Ohe Taiyam a nyishi man from nearest village at Seijosa. He invited us for tea at his place. When we went to Ohe's place, we saw a traditional nyishi house. We were so excited. This was my 3rd visit to local community's home. We were amazed by their hospitality. We got to know so many amazing and wild stories of Pakke Tiger Reserve.
This one was a worthy visit to pakke. I got to know about so many stories of Pakke, had a chance to attend the Nyokum yullo celebration,got a chance to visit the Naksaparvat, an archaeological site representing the extention of the Brahmaputra valley culture, got to see so many new species of birds and mammals and the most amazing one was witnessing the roosting of Wreathed Hornbills in the village before the sunset.
If you want to experience the thrill and beauty of untouched, unexplored places  than please visit Pakke once in a lifetime. You'll be amazed by this evergreen place.",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102956114449355280661,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPE-sTC7205WpO9HIttXMiuZ8tUdiR_ibx9N69L=w1920-h1080-k-no,birding,,,,,,,,Pakke Tiger Reserve - Outlook Traveller,,4,,,6,mammals,True,,5,,,,,,,4.5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,True,,4.3,,,14,,,,,,,,,,,"3RX9+84W, Itakhola Seijusa Road, Seijosa, Arunachal Pradesh 790103, India",,8141,,,False,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO7T5tRgnyDKTPzS-rWelM6zjENeO998FGBTBoP=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,Pakke Tiger Reserve & Kameng river,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMF6It7LXrx1rgONWz5iWs2BsSeWNSOnN7M7Rn9=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,2023-03-16T10:50:12.261Z,,,,,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Pakke+Tiger+Reserve/@27.0983555,92.8178291,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x374361ed474cb9a9:0x2185f9b84d19a84e!8m2!3d27.0983555!4d92.8178291!16s%2Fm%2F04mw_ql?hl=en",,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO0BGzRxVAGpa9Z-nvVSp6rBeYJfFaRz7JgKKZA=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,True,,,5,,,ChIJqblMR-1hQzcRTqgZTbj5hSE,,a month ago,KUMAR VISHAL,,2023-02-03T18:09:20.600Z,5,,People also search for,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPaHRwl0FDtCX3TmRioQzowPwD2ry0-ucpLo5n-=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,,,,,,,,,Pakke WLS & Tiger Reserve,,,,,,,,,True,,,2,,False,,18,Tourist attraction,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMxdg8FUtDvS33mhS1MYx6yuFAn8eHi-5NZWqfC=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOZqfpamOJVBVGHkzyo-V7be-XahHriSuD20eUJ=w1920-h1080-k-no,True,,"A great place to visit for wildlife watching ,specially Birdwatching",,,Parks,,,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMtK6uyipqIXqdCVAd4rrgkG4qEwy5L3bfbHXz9=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,,,,a month ago,,,Arunachal Pradesh,,

Laokhowa Wildlife Sanctuary is protected area located in the state of Assam in India. This wildlife sanctuary covers 70.13 km², on the south bank of the Brahmaputra River in Nagaon district, It is situated 40 km downstream of the Kaziranga National Park and 30 km northwest of the Orang National Park on the other side of the river BrahmaputraIt is a part of the Laokhowa-Burachapori eco-system. The sanctuary is an ideal habitat for Indian rhinoceros and Asiatic water buffaloes. Other animals found here are the royal Bengal tiger, Indian leopard, Indian boar, civet, leopard cat, hog deer, etc. Over 200 species of birds have been recorded in the sanctuary, including migratory birds.

Laokhowa had more than 70 Indian rhinos in early 1980s which were all killed by poachers. In 2016, two rhinos, a mother and her daughter, were reintroduced to the sanctuary from Kaziranga National Park as part of the Indian Rhino Vision 2020 (IRV 2020) program, but both animals died within months due to natural causes.

It is open for tourists from the beginning of November to the end of April. এতিয়া এইখন অলপ ঠাণ্ডা বাবে আৰু ভাল লগা হল।",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105350014338723125388,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNOmSoPvJhq2BQsiFITKs8GaJKru9PDLMOZ92VH=w1920-h1080-k-no,ecosystem,94,,76,,89,95,85,"Laokhowa Wildlife Sanctuary, Kathalguri | Address - TripHobo",82,1,88,14,5,picnic,,,4,77,Wednesday,0,91,93,93,4.2,Thursday,96,,12,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMUIzMOLE-UpblmOhT0n7S_pQ7mgzEO7Gj5YDX0=w150-h150-k-no-p,16,10,10,,Monday,7,,9,,89,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMWCf_rV19mHjZRxHcoTZBoLcWSbzbrPDIALNZG=w150-h150-k-no-p,4.2,,2,8,86,6,14,87,78,,16,94,87,87,"FMVG+7WR, Kathalguri, Assam 782124, India",89,1429,94,93,False,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOLAOUglWnAkwUz5eVIlpaS6SXXxHNC5v7Ducee=w1920-h1080-k-no,8,93,6,Burachapori Wildlife Sanctuary,True,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMlLHaNSiMJBTJFMsjnrERtpYwdWSy0WaLmzP5W=w1920-h1080-k-no,76,87,2023-03-16T10:57:29.692Z,16,,লাওখোৱা অভয়াৰণ্য,9,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Laokhowa+Wildlife+Sanctuary/@26.4932305,92.6772672,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x3744dc6bf5ad223d:0x9496f6c26347b48f!8m2!3d26.4932305!4d92.6772672!16s%2Fm%2F0vxfs6z?hl=en",19,15,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOf5P1ZlELWqsC0kDeHc1_PhqoS3_Gt4-ceBlqD=w150-h150-k-no-p,17,89,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipObW-3WkT3Ul_JvFZ2uiEezofikGf1HSiDfN713=w1920-h1080-k-no,,13,21,,,80,4,96,19,ChIJPSKt9WvcRDcRj7RHY8L2lpQ,22,3 months ago,Preetam,86,2022-12-16T14:52:23.397Z,4,100,People also search for,18,86,17,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPB79dnvtXfAO1B15ZVyqxJcj8_dcSC_7roBQjb=w1920-h1080-k-no,,85,7,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPCkO5eJUFdp31OH173u5gy2DyB_yLCqTEtZ2BU=w150-h150-k-no-p,0,84,5,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111550868836427561864?hl=en-US,82,1,,ভোমোৰাগুৰি বৰখেলৰ নামঘৰ ও শংকৰী কৃষ্টি চৰ্চা কেন্দ্ৰ,76,12,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMWK3kFs90a6Tkp6BQAQajKL7ErpSZDaHdLAIQj=w150-h150-k-no-p,5,87,,86,14,True,21,2,17,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMX55JxadR3RayKZnQqW29vrM2nS7TYxHSS65qi=w150-h150-k-no-p,False,,9,Tourist attraction,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOP8Wftndmfcb8OQzWqhMr57XePlVs0GXMHeQ80=w1920-h1080-k-no,79,,Open 24 hours,4,,23,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOihfKG7_LpMO0aTaERTTlgaYqARhdr2KW3iv2w=w1920-h1080-k-no,True,4,I have worked there.

Map, what you are going follow on Google will bring you only to a spot on highway, before important turn. So you need to drive another 10-15 meters and there will be turn on a right, there will be some mini shop's to buy some snacks, you can ask people for directions all the way. Basically you need to drive right to the hills, this waterfall exactly there and it will take additional 15/17 km, road isn't great, but people on bikes were confident, our big car went, just drive isn't smooth.
I put my pics in chronological way.

First you are driving through beautiful trees alleys then entering local village and turn again right, there will be another turn just ask people and then drive on this road until you will face something like entering, there you will pay 20 rupees per person and we paid 120 for car. Very little left from journey, around 500 meters you'll arrive in open space, park yourself and take walk for 5 minutes up to a hill.

P. S. I was to say that I loved all journey, road was beautiful, pineapples fields was so lovely, little houses so cute, amount variety of plants was surprising to notice, like winter is not here. About waterfall, I believe in summer you will see strong, full of water waterfall, but now it is emptier, buuut still beautiful, no regret. I saw heavy rocks, birds singing songs, wow it was great vibes. There is comfortable sitting area.
Sadly I need to add that people left bit of litter there and it's not what we need to do. I was regretting that I forgot to take my garbage packs, I would clean it.

Of all Ahom ruins, it is one of the grandest examples of Tai Ahom architecture. The Talatal Ghar is also the largest of all Tai Ahom monuments.

Visitors nowadays can only view the ground floor, the first floor, and what remains of the 2nd and 3rd floors of the Talatal Ghar. The floors of the Talatal Ghar below the ground have been sealed off.

History

Swargadeo Rudra Singha shifted the capital of the Ahom Kingdom from Garhgaon to Rangpur in AD 1702-03. For about a century thereafter, Rangpur remained the capital. It is located in the western part of Sivasagar. The earliest constructions were commissioned by SwargadeoRudra Singhain AD 1698.[1][2] Rangpur was the capital of the Ahom Kingdom and served as its military-station.

A good place to see gibbons, and a pretty organized and serious wildlife sanctuary. Entry only by guided walk. Price is 600 per group for guide and ""gunman"" (to protect from wild elephants and leopards - not usually seen), plus per person entry fee of 500 (foreign) or 50 (Indian). The guides will take you into the forest for a couple hours, and can usually find some gibbons for you if you come in the morning (early, around 7am, is said to be best). Langur monkeys, several macaque species, and giant squirrels are also possible, but unpredictable.

If possible, bring binoculars - the gibbons never come down from the tall trees. In wet weather, you also might want something to cover the top of your shoes to protect from leeches. Probably not an issue on the main trails, but guides will sometimes take you bushwhacking off trail to find the gibbons.

The park can close unpredictably, especially lately because of a rhino from Kaziranga on the loose (they're trying to find and move it). In case it's closed or you're not satisfied, you can try walking the road between the sanctuary entrance and the highway. You can sometimes find gibbons and langur monkeys there too if you look carefully. Make sure not to walk there at night though - it's prohibited due to serious danger from wild elephants.",11,68,Food & Drink,63,75,80,10,2,73,1,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNMjlyr8xkl0ahN4s7DWcv557DerLtW6d-FzsZb=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,6,87,75,a week ago,,82,Assam,6,70

Pauna the highest peak in Peren district located at Benreu Village, Nagaland, India, inhabited by the Zeliang community.

Mt. Pauna is the third highest peak in Nagaland after Mt. Saramati at Kiphire dist. and Mt. Japfü at Kohima dist. the highest and second highest peak respectively.

It's a tiring bit to climb all the way up, but incredibly a recreational trekking to do. The steps build can be counted upto 23k - 25k (approx.) with a speedometer measurement all the way of about 2km walkthrough to its peak.

I've visited in the month of January, 2023... It's a bit of dried up and silent, but they say summer time is the best to visit and experience altitude on a clear day skyline. Preparation is a key point, and forecasts been checked in priority.

Go ahead, team up with your friends or family and experience the beautiful village of Benreu and Mt. Pauna the highest peak in Peren district.

Breath taking!

From the disposition of the broken stone blocks scattered here, archeological experts have opined that the original temple was a Panchayatan type of temple where five temples are arranged in such a way that the main shrine with the deity of the principal god is placed at the center of a square place, the 4 corners of which is the site of 4 similar but smaller temples with the idols of (usually) 4 different deities.
Experts also concluded that the main temple was dedicated to Lord Vishnu.

The ruins contain broken stone blocks of different sizes and many of those have stunningly beautiful bas-relief decorations of geometric and floral designs, gods, demigods, dancers and warriors.
There are few high relief work showing Avatars of Lord Vishnu.
The decorations are so beautiful that only one phrase can describe them honestly : sublime poetry in stone.",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109358567714078016775,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMVRsSf3pDhX4hg1zCgDmTU8djWDWPU5GGzHts3=w1920-h1080-k-no,relics,,,0,,,0,0,Bamuni Hills | Incredible India,0,,2,15,7,pillars,,,5,2,Wednesday,,,,0,5,Thursday,26,,13,,17,11,11,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNkROuTNDFpi_nKWWBhNvCptZMc_O8JkUSlcO1e=w150-h150-k-no-p,Monday,8,,10,,32,,,4.3,,,31,2,7,15,,0,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPdULJDrZl9F_SmxpoJT1IRqjQoxWgraxl9EzjR=w150-h150-k-no-p,17,39,0,,"JR88+PGF, Mahabhairab, Tezpur, Assam 784001, India",,2168,10,0,False,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNHfb5w2_51hrrvtSLn90BeFAFjtePGzQvmJd52=w1920-h1080-k-no,9,9,7,Padum Pukhuri,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOekdIXZVM0BtzfqkRHcFSlBKBkxGNqz4sqB7JI=w1920-h1080-k-no,0,0,2023-03-16T11:33:30.824Z,17,,বামুনি হিলস,10,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bamuni+Hills/@26.6168205,92.8163081,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x3744e857c0a58ebb:0x42231836b8cf73c8!8m2!3d26.6168205!4d92.8163081!16s%2Fg%2F11dxdptg1s?hl=en",20,16,,18,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPMtqNlCWLq31fKOXWjkE6kK_JQuXUfDwPsm3Kg=w1920-h1080-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOBFZ0MZc1xV2jAmhIK7SH6ABwWSKOnpxsUo0Uc=w150-h150-k-no-p,14,22,,,0,5,34,20,ChIJu46lwFfoRDcRyHPPuDYYI0I,,a month ago,Burhanul Hoque,18,2023-02-23T11:47:30.448Z,5,0,People also search for,19,18,18,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMhXtA43t_rSEZaEcMNW4NC2RviRQ3qeND0kNu0=w1920-h1080-k-no,,0,8,,,0,6,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116737059214905600800?hl=en-US,2,,,Bamuni hills park,2,13,,6,0,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPqQrMxxVQPwIFj2xUgAVVQvLdFQbYmgIvwhjOd=w150-h150-k-no-p,0,15,True,22,,,,False,,33,Tourist attraction,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNNx2HbTdU0sEpe-rjKAJxbL6q0OhWUKMwncqAZ=w1920-h1080-k-no,1,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNUVjmjf16jnsh0ZSHPUwI2dNNE9-P6sijbcVzr=w150-h150-k-no-p,6 AM to 4 PM,5,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOaatlnxCEafF803RHY4IZXsoTfrKN76NmsJCay=w1920-h1080-k-no,,5,Ruins of an ancient temple dedicated to Lord Vishnu. The temple is dated to the 9th century CE. Though the temple has been destroyed and it contains only the ruins of the pillars and walls but it feels really good coming to this place. There's a feeling of belongingness and it feels really good knowing that Tezpur Town has history as old as 1000 years and this site is proof of it.
