Sri Lalitha Someswara Swamy Temple is a highly revered shrine dedicated to Lord Shiva. It is believed to have been built during the 7th century. Somasila is a well-known tourist attraction of Mahabubnagar that consists of 15 temples. These temples are dedicated to Lord Shiva and are enshrined with several Shivalingas.
The temple was shifted from old Somasila village to higher altitude to protect it from being submerged in Krishna water during the construction of Srisailam Dam. Its relocation is a marvel in itself. The surroundings are amazing with lot of views.

Far away from crowd. We visited on a Sunday and we could hardly see 2-3 familes. Food is a challenge, but if you go towards the View Point, you will find lot of local food hotels which serves good food. The road from Jadcherla is a smooth drive and we enjoyed our trip. There is boat (launch) ride available (15 mins - adult 50/- childred 30/-) You can pay double if the group agrees and stay in water for 30 mins. That is another amazing experience on Krishna Waters.

Now is the time to go before its highly promoted by tourism (krishna project) and you will see more people visiting.",,5,2023-03-15T10:17:16.118Z,,,,,2023-02-04T07:29:40.315Z,People also search for,Somasila Bathing Ghat,,,9,,,,peaceful,,,,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP6-nVdhhG53JoKWjVUsGpYv7hXZAhGBuIxJWQF=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,Someswara Swamy Temple,,,,207,,5,,,76,,,Somasila,,,,,,,,,,,,,,24,,,,,,,,13,,,,,,,https://www.youtube.com › watch,,4.3,3974,,,IN,,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoNk1DcGJBEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x9a30882e20cd7681!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICh6MCpbA%7CCgwI5JL4ngYQ8Iq-lgE%7C?hl=en-US,,,False,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOdueay6jKx-7LIqQBGT3LAVuF06TjruMgVXNaR=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,,,,,,267,Somasila is a pilgrimage and tourist destination because of the 15 temples and Krishna River backwaters.

As I stood on the bridge, I couldn't help but marvel at the sheer beauty of the nature that surrounded me.
The bridge itself was an engineering marvel, with its long span and slender cables that seemed to disappear into the horizon. As I walked across it, the gentle swaying motion added to the experience, making me feel like I was walking on air. Looking down, I could see the gentle ripples on the water's surface, and occasionally, a fish would leap out, adding to the serene atmosphere.
As I reached the middle of the bridge, I paused to take in the view. The lake spread out before me was nothing short of awe-inspiring. It was a moment that I will never forget.
The cable suspension bridge over the lake is a testament to the beauty of nature and the ingenuity of human engineering. It's a must-visit destination for anyone who loves the outdoors and wants to experience the breathtaking scenery that only nature can provide.",,5,2023-03-15T10:17:39.456Z,7,15,1,19,2023-02-26T10:46:53.953Z,People also search for,Hanging Bridge,,3,7,1,,+91 40 2326 2154,evening,1,0,5,1,,,3 weeks ago,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPeNIJzoX3mfpoZusTfqKHQeUwRQIbfp8tC4c8=w150-h150-k-no-p,3,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOuLBghSQ8ghW1kr6IhjEMU0mh0mhrGZYMWmTk=w150-h150-k-no-p,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNCoDPWWzUWumjYsPOTU2I8Ow0_dlTHRE7mYqo=w150-h150-k-no-p,19,23,0,"Adventure Park, Komati Cheruvu Siddipet",15,,,2,22,5,11,25,69,,11,Siddipet,15,6,18,,,22,18,14,9,4,15,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN7iyJbal3YW9Lx1Xc4IwfwrZiTFx3QD1Gvtew=w150-h150-k-no-p,,41,6,21,15,16,7,20,21,8,3,0,,17,20,18,https://www.hyderabadzone.com › attractions,1,4.5,2632,1,13,IN,14,,13,3,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoXzhtYkZnEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x74428ab5da41a232!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICh_8mbFg%7CCgwInfHsnwYQiLraxgM%7C?hl=en-US,,,False,2,1,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMkyyYLw5gvuruJnb7OxU_9EDSEYThOZ_R4oS_D=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,1,12,,7,3,,178,"Komati Cheruvu Suspension Bridge. 4.5.

Also, cafeteria nd toilets are available. The entrance peacock one is nice to take pictures.
--> The main good thing is ticket price is only Rs.5/- per adults nd parking Rs.10/-.
--> The worst thing is here the Columbus doesn't have lock after we sit nd it starts swinging nd it's very dangerous.","Hello Park Manager and the Team

Note : FULL TANK UR CARS & BIKES AS THERE ARE NO PETROL PUMPS NEAR BY FOR AROUND 15 KMS.
The place is good surrounded by hills but no proper maintenance.
we couldn’t get into the water as the water looks totally green filled with lots & lots of Algae.
Price :The boat ride is quite expensive they are charging 2000 rs/- for one boat for 20 mins ride .
we paid 1000 Rs . For 3 people which i felt was quite expensive .
Food : As shown in few youtube videos we can see many locals having food stalls . But didnt dare to eat the fish there as we saw they are not cleaning the fish properly & not maintaining proper hygiene standards.( what i felt )
Try to go there early mornings as it was too hot & sunny even in January ☀️
It might be better if we would have visited in rainy season.
My Final thought 💭 I would not recommend this place 👎🏻 instead u can visit komati chervu (siddipet ) which is far better & beautiful & well maintained.
Hope this review is helpful .","Is it safe for couples

The viewpoint offers a stunning view of the backwaters of the Krishna River, surrounded by hills and forests.

The viewpoint is well-maintained and the location is easily accessible, and there is ample parking space available.

The view from the Octopus View Point is breathtaking, with the river and its backwaters creating a serene and peaceful ambiance. The lush greenery of the surrounding hills and forests adds to the natural beauty of the location.

The Octopus View Point is an ideal spot for nature lovers and photographers. The viewpoint offers a perfect vantage point to capture stunning photographs of the river and the surrounding hills. It's also an excellent spot to relax and unwind, away from the hustle and bustle of the city.

Overall, I would highly recommend a visit to the Octopus View Point at Srisailam to anyone visiting the area.

Excellent place and a historic heritage spot. The area of fort is large, hilly and beautiful. The view from the top most point is breath taking. Try to avoid visiting this place in Sunny Day because of the heat else keep umbrella, hat or water bottle to deal with it. Not recommended for elderly people/ people having heart issue to climb to the top of the Fort as the steps are not easy to take. Overall it was an amazing experience.

Nice place to visit if you are in Hyderabad. The evening light and sound show is under repair hence we couldn't watch it. This happens in evening 6:30. Make sure you check it's website before planning for this show.
Fort is big and has good history. Make sure you either read book or better take a tourist guide along. There are places where even if you whisper the sound travels more than a kilometre. Very thoughtful how in history people actually used knowledge of science which we just read and never use. Simple concepts but executed in perfection.
You do not have washrooms here. So take care.",,3,2023-03-15T10:36:25.747Z,,,,,2023-01-30T21:32:36.506Z,People also search for,Bala Hissar Darwaza,,,6,,,,experience,,,,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMsuCxlOPzX4AzxqtE2UjInyUeGGH0vmds1ECHM=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,Sultan Nagar Fort,,,,90,,5,,,238,,,Hyderabad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,26,,,,,,,,10,,,,,,,https://www.holidify.com › ... › Hyderabad,,4.2,4295,,,IN,,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCbDVqNGZnEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x4216c61f4217a42a!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDBl5j4fg%7CCgwI9O7gngYQiPPV8QE%7C?hl=en-US,,,False,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPPfRoHUGcWq-vlKP-ez8VG6mI_WY08sM-USBhF=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,,,,,,54,Golconda Fort is located in the western part of Hyderabad city and is about 9 km from the Hussain Sagar Lake.

This park has so many slides in which you can enjoy a lot. And my favorite slide was tornado. It brings you down very speed that u feel afraid for a while. It has many dry games too in which you can enjoy a lot. It also has a wave pool in which you can experience the feeling of waves just like near the sea's and beaches. Best time to visit is from 11AM to 6PM. I suggest you to visit this park between Monday to Friday as there will be less public these days so u can enjoy with your friends and family without waiting in a queue. They don't allow you to take the outside food. I couldn't play many dry games because of rain. There are separate rooms for gents and ladies to exchange dresses and also they provide costumes on rental basis. Nylon clothes are recommended so that you can slip easily on the slides. There are lockers if you need to keep your belongings.,What is the entry fees,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO8r8vnZd7EZ7n_J8rgSS_TlSluiXDURbOol7eu=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113462447889396162722?hl=en-US,water rides,48,0,0,0,,,,,"https://www.google.com/maps/search/telangana+places+to+visit/@17.7871965,78.2571252,8z/data=!4m2!2m1!6e1?hl=en",,True,7,73,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPS9Cv2B05ar-_ce5M6IUI6-XGk-kCwnG_5QBaU=w150-h150-k-no-p,True,10,Good amusement park.

Malwala Palace was located along the road leading towards east from Charminar. It was constructed in Mughal and Rajasthani style and in Hyderabadi courtyard style, was known for its richly carved. wooden pavilion. Other than Raja Bhagwandas Bagh Pavilion, Malwala Palace was the only other palace in Hyderabad having a wooden pavilion.Barring the grand gateway, the entire palace complex has been demolished in August 2000 and a shopping mall has been built in its place.

The Malwalas were responsible for the revenue records of the Nizam's dominions. The palace belonged to a noble family of Dewan Chandulal, the Malwala or the custodians of the Revenue Records (Daftar -i- Mal) of the erstwhile Hyderabad State. Built in the early 18th century by the noble Sagar Mall during the reign of first nizam in 1724, this was one of the very few palaces of Hyderabad built in the Mughal and Rajasthani styles of architecture. It acquired the name Malwala as Sagar Mall was the custodian of revenue records (maal) in hyderabad state. At the time department of revenue was held by the Mathur Kayastha family or Malwala family. During the 1940s, at the time of one of the family descendants, Raja Dharam Karan, the grandeur of the palace was resplendent and was noted for its glory and power.

It was an exquisite Diwan Khana made of huge arches in lacquered wood and painted with vegetable dyes and two galleries about 80 m in length flanking the Diwan Khana on each side constructed with Rangoon teak rafters. The galleries housed priceless collection of antique Indian art and artifacts. The palace also had a library, which boasted of a collection of rare books and manuscripts from the 10th century A.D. It is one of the few wooden edifices in the city, a double-storeyed mansion with inner courtyards, with its ornamental archway entrance rich in stucco work and a fountain at the centre. There were wooden pavilions on two sides and overhanging wooden balconies with intricate patterns in Rajasthani and Mughal architectural styles. The palace had two wings, the eastern part used for official business, celebrations and social functions and the western one for residential purpose. The eastern part extended to 2460 square metres with a beautiful cistern standing in the middle of the vast courtyard. It consisted of a series of galleries in two floors and a wooden pavilion, which like the Diwan-i-Khas of the Delhi Fort is ""an oriental magnificence in wood."" Vegetable dyes were used for decorating the lacquered wood and the walls. Tragedy struck the Malwala Palace, a protected heritage building, having rare wooden pavilion considered the ""bride"" among the garland of palaces around Charminar when the major portion as important as the ""heart"" was reduced to rubble in 2000.

The Banyan tree 🌳 itself is 800 yrs old so its being restored. The aerial roots (udalu in Telugu) are spread over acres of land of one main tree. The view and feel of such majestic tree is amazing.

There is a museum, a temple, a dargah, a zoo & deer park and a children's park constructed along with this for day time camping and picnic with family and friends.

The whole place is very clean and neatly maintained. Kids can play happily all around and they'll enjoy the wildlife in the region.

The temple there acts as a display for centuries old ruins from all around India. There are stones brought from various timelines and given with details.

Large old trees abound, a visual treat for plant lovers. The park maintenance could be better in few areas, but even then it's great to visit. Turtles in the water body, bats and kites in the trees are an added attraction!

Only request to the authorities to allow kids to carry a football. Ours was stopped at the entrance because of this, and a ball won't hurt anyone :)"," Pls tell me the Nearest way to reach the park from secunderabad station.

Improvements needed - Drinking water. There are only 2-3 drinking water fountains available and none of them were working. They also have a place where they charge 5Rs to fill water bottle and that too was broken.
Eating area - There is no proper restaurant or seating area. They don't even have a hand wash area. Do they expect people to wash hands in the open with their own water bottles or eat with dirty hands after roaming around half the zoo?
Directions/Information - There are no clear directions or route to take for optimal viewing experience.

The village is known for its handloom weaving, and it was fascinating to see the weavers at work, creating intricate and beautiful designs.

The village is also home to a variety of temples and monuments, which provided a glimpse into the rich cultural heritage of the region. I particularly enjoyed visiting the Sri Seetha Rama Chandra Swamy temple, which was both beautiful and peaceful.

What stood out to me the most was the warm hospitality of the locals. They were friendly and welcoming, and went out of their way to make me feel at home.

Overall, my experience at Pochampally village was truly unforgettable. I would highly recommend this village to anyone looking for a unique and enriching cultural experience in Telangana.

Like me, don't be surprised if you cannot see the 1000 pillars at once, if you look closely, the 1000 pillars are engraved intricately close to one another and form the walls of the temple. The beautiful carvings are on the walls and ceilings are mesmerizing, the temple is dedicated to lord Shiva. The vibe here is so serene, we spent about 40mins here. There is no entry fee. The well maintained park surrounding the temple premises is good for relaxing. A must visit place for architecture and history enthusiasts.","Collecting 50/- for Vehicle parking near Thousand Pillar temple is not a reasonable price for Middle class families. Let them provide some extra service like cleaning All the mirrors of the Vehicle, which will be satisfactory for the customers. However, the person available there doesn't do any work except collecting the money.  The Bhadrakali Devasthanam is providing free  parking facility near Bhadrakali temple. The better price only for parking is 
Bikes -10/-,  
Cars-20/- , 
Bus-50. 

Government will look after the Development of the Temple. Lord Shiva never expected his development with a common man's daily wages.

Temple is in city and just few minutes away from Badrakali Temple. So if you plan to visit cover that as well. We could not due to time constraint.

There is small well kind of place, it's called Kolanu where devotees probably used to take bath in olden days. Now it's a residence for loads of tortoises.

These beautiful creatures are abundant and see less and less shy about coming close to humans.

Outside the park there is a big jogging ring that seems to be open to the public, however there are very, very, very few entrance points and you may walk 1km or so before you can find one.
The path is packed dirt, and is leveled and safe for the most part. Just be on the lookout of dog feces which are all over the track. It would be nice if they created a few RO water stations throughout the track for the community.  There is really only one entrance point, that's a bit negative for such a huge park.

The gardens are constantly watered by workers and well kept. The entrance fee is nominal ( around ₹50 ) and this park is absolutely giant. You could easily spent a couple hours in here.

One would need half a day to completely explore this complex.

For elders it is bit difficult to climb to the top. But it’s quite interesting. Complex is big and takes time to explore. While going take sufficient water and wear comfortable dress which makes you walk easily.

Parking is a mess here.  There is no dedicated parking.  You have to park outside. In the crowded days if you go late you may not get the parking.

Tickets are Available online.  This could save you time in the queue.
