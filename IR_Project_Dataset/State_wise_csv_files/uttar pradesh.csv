A nice place to visit and walk around if you're in Lucknow. I wasn't able to gain access since the electronic payment methods were down but I got to visit the lawns which were nice.

It was also a bit crowded which I assume was due to Eid so I didn't mind not being able to access the temple itself.

But a fine place to walk around (especially in the mild December sunshine) and enjoying the bird calls drifting in the midst of trees. There are designated look out points from where the Taj can be well seen, including benches to park oneself. I would say one hour is the bare minimum. But there are some off-beat paths that go deeper into the woods. There are washrooms in the main area, including an open lawn, ideal for picnics and even some swings for the children. It is interesting that this nature spot is so close to the Taj and easily accessible from the Taj East Gate Road.

It was initially exhibited in the central hall of the main Residency building in the presence of Viceroy Lord Northbrook during his visit to Lucknow in 1873. The location and measurement of the buildings were taken from various drawings and after a careful survey, together with the description obtained from the owners and servants of the houses. The name of the structures as they existed before 1857 are plotted carefully. Surely recommend at least 10 minutes beside this model. For this reason, I have not photographed or shown it on my YouTube channel.

I have used a rare and grim portrait as the master picture that showcases that violence is never a solution to any problem because there will always be collateral damage leaving behind a grieving family who will work for revenge. Mahatma Gandhi said ""An eye for an eye will turn the whole World Blind"" The first War of independence was a result of years of suppression forcing ordinary soldiers looking to quench their hunger for their families, to take up arms. This mutiny left about 2000 people dead in Lucknow itself!

The left side of the portrait shows Henry Lawrence shot dead while seating upright on his chair. I have mentioned the incident in the earlier paragraphs too. On the right side is the portrait of Susanna Palmer a 19-year-old who went away too soon. She was hit by a canon ball in this room itself. Even a good cause can suddenly feel mindless when we analyze it in hindsight!

It’s especially worth the visit because unlike the other forts which have undergone makeovers from every conquer this fort, being out of the big cities, has remained intact, minus the gems and gold of course. A short summary is that a holy man who lived here granted the kings wish of having a male heir and so it became an auspicious place and the king moved the capital here for a time. If you have been to the Agra Fort with a guide it is not necessary to have one here too as the elements of the design are very similar for example where the water flowed and where rooms are. They have a few signs but almost every guidebook has a self guided walkthrough as well.

To get to the fort you have to take a bus (30rupees per person) to go up the mountain where the fort is perched. About a 4 minute walk from the parking lot, there is a pathway to the right of the shops leading you to another small lot, where a few guys are sitting at a makeshift table. It doesn’t look official but a bus does show up and they give you an official ticket to ride.

Once at the top you pay entry into the fort. And again there will be more guides offering services.

So far this has been the most peaceful fort for us to visit and once inside we were not haggled at all. Definitely a perfect stop on the drive to Jaipur from Agra.",6,13,58,Shopping,39,,,12,,0,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM426JblNXSHq0bZjew1lySySY5itySYPA1eGFC=w1920-h1080-k-no,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNtkc-b2Q0k6tt4-0Cl_CLBrqvLPBZva6_gfdzX=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMei4R89xt8H1kzm6sVgDs6SQGgn_-Gjw5TehXq=w150-h150-k-no-p,,8,0,0,,3 weeks ago,,Uttar Pradesh,8,58

I visited this place in the afternoon, and spent around an hour sitting under the sun in the cold weather. Not many people come here at this time.

You will be pleasantly surprised by the actual similarities of the wax statues with the celebrities. There are various props present at Madame Tussauds Museum Delhi, which makes it so much fun to pose with. Great ambience and beautiful decor makes it a grand place to get clicked with your most favourite Indian and International celebrities.
Highly recommended! I simply loved my experience and visit at the museum.

I had visited the place today and found it very good. The ambience is so colourful. Each personality statue seems so original as if they are really standing with you. I personally liked Michael Jackson statue a lot. Each personality has own accessories also so that we can feel the same while clicking the pictures.

You will not find garbage lying everywhere as it used to be few years back.

For those who are planning to give it a visit, be careful to not take polythene bags to to zoo as the security will not allow you to carry it into the premise. Though you can carry the food items inside but try to pack them in paper bags.

Kids train along with Caddy service are also available within the zoo to add on to the thrill.
You will also finds small adventure parks within the zoo where you can enjoy, but you will have to buy additional ticket for that..

Nearest metro station to this tomb is KD Singh Babu metro station. There are also share autos from charbag railway station/ hazratganj to parivartan chowk. From parivartan chowk this tomb is at a walking distance.

This place is less visited by tourists but if anyone is near hazratganj plz do visit this place. Entry is free here. There are two tombs in this complex and both these tombs require more maintanence by the concerned authorities. Lawns and garden is decently managed in this complex.

If you're planning to go in Lucknow ambedkar park should be your first priority. If you are going to this park you have to take tickets which is not too costly and trust me the view which you will see inside the ticket price will be negligible. The best beauty of the park you will see when you go on top area. The park is very beautiful and large and best beauty added by Elephants which are present there. White marbles make appearances like Water is everywhere. Sun and clouds make it more beautiful and in night it becomes more beautiful when lights blow here i must say it will be most memorable trip of your life.,16,77,23,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOrtyJfeinAgP9L2rtirsbm4M9OGndm1t3yaxiC=w1920-h1080-k-no,,equality,64,,65,,79,,84,Dr. Ambedkar Park Lucknow Entry Fee,,54,,1,10,54,14 april,True,,,37,35,,Wednesday,20,9,68,,4.2,Thursday,1,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOY-t-GmwX946Gof7KWVjrJ36s8nGRGXDpLUyKe=w150-h150-k-no-p,,6,6,,Monday,,3,,5,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOZ5teX-t2N4I9z8qmQLYUx--_BqxCJ-dmFr9SX=w150-h150-k-no-p,,1,True,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPwJHcA6o3IzQnG3OBfE81-NJlI1BNYkb2BtlDq=w150-h150-k-no-p,4.3,,22,192,1,2,10,,71,56,12,,83,22,"Vipul Khand 2, Vipul Khand 3, Vipin Khand, Gomti Nagar, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh 226010, India",5,99631,,,False,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMOUjmKK6yaUjVf-G-G5ccu0kIyYqG1iXIvWzb9=w1920-h1080-k-no,4,0,2,Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia Park,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMl_lbYnQL1w1R-8JVCQ-rGihVhFc9jI8o4fk3l=w150-h150-k-no-p,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOBdpCLwkjcPgX2i8nlp1HneczW_CrAoBd-p4xC=w1920-h1080-k-no,50,88,2023-03-17T17:09:40.400Z,12,Ambedkar park/hathi park,अंबेडकर मेमोरियल पार्क,5,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ambedkar+Memorial+Park/@26.8461559,80.9784641,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x399957b11ca04015:0x62a8e15e3b7c7c1d!8m2!3d26.8461559!4d80.9784641!16s%2Fm%2F0bmcnc6?hl=en",15,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNOE9cQGrcBRq7dkzS8W9fr80M7zKYha_uyGNjP=w150-h150-k-no-p,13,80,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPiWfqa6d9R4COcFoyuMMnVrnW6UqEsEekgc55Q=w1920-h1080-k-no,,9,17,,,78,36,1,15,ChIJFUCgHLFXmTkRHXx8O17hqGI,18,3 months ago,Sunil Dev,4,2023-01-22T02:12:37.480Z,5,People also search for,84,14,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPZbvqxZoUBCuql3TdjybpIortXuKGQhgQKE3_N=w150-h150-k-no-p,7,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMHoUzvDTouwmA3ycwd7XB2wiafQkBjOKAguMD9=w1920-h1080-k-no,,75,3,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMBME9mWvOgz0sEUfehZZnDkV8U1ndLDtDaVesq=w150-h150-k-no-p,20,83,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106558209150552557001?hl=en-US,1,5,,,Begum Hazrat Mahal Park,39,8,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMjnRRVN2sB1MNE8v2Ih4zDe_jOvHkUc4SPiOGr=w150-h150-k-no-p,1,1,,79,10,True,,22,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMEkQO4rwrwRMcE0g2M6yawsfB-orELZWUrbzGx=w150-h150-k-no-p,False,300,,Tourist attraction,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNpB_VnqUPWDRKd9B_4YMlzRyQkJ18u9YI0le_J=w1920-h1080-k-no,5,,Closed,0,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMYRyBrq_0vYJa-myaw_WThJkvkj8-NOA2RMU_G=w1920-h1080-k-no,,19,"The place is very nice and beautiful.

It was not too crowded when I went here and the place was fairly well maintained in terms of cleanliness. Good place to hangout and do some photoshoots.
Significance: -
The Residency, also called as the British Residency and Residency Complex, is a group of several buildings in a common precinct in the city of Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India. It served as the residence for the British Resident General who was a representative in the court of the Nawab.

Quiet place and also good to visit. Entry ticket 10 rupees and the museum cost is also somewhat 10 or 20 .

Try to clean the campus and clean and enjoy the essence of history.",22,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOzAtxPQCM18yPNHlEOvxHvhbSRb90LZuR3sRiX=w1920-h1080-k-no,,siege,,,0,,,0,0,History of Lucknow Residency,,45,,8,16,34,ancient monuments,,,,30,51,,Wednesday,,,,0,4.4,Thursday,5,,14,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMyd225-tRMagMUi11GbCieQ2eZrjUWfQq_fbuS=w150-h150-k-no-p,18,12,12,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMZLLJKlqyRflDXLxstNHNwpDkzbXmfw-0ivV-7=w150-h150-k-no-p,Monday,,9,,11,,,81,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMds5yImEzLovUZ9T5a86IWUxTfK2_rRpISV-GH=w150-h150-k-no-p,4.3,,,48,17,8,16,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPAFU0U_QhY19D1rd30efE2LPPbHWj00c-hsmNH=w150-h150-k-no-p,0,,18,58,0,,"VW6G+7P3, Mahatma Gandhi Marg, Deep Manak Nagar, Qaisar Bagh, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh 226001, India",,46008,24,13,False,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMGUv4XQEblyMjioIh1UgEHghSI9h4l9NKsrc7i=w1920-h1080-k-no,10,32,8,1857-Memorial Museum Residency,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNP2hBsOcQ4B0TFrZY3DCKy3IfdhyLeNA3kSyWi=w1920-h1080-k-no,37,0,2023-03-17T17:12:33.206Z,18,,"रेजीडेंसी - भारतीय पुरातत्व विभाग, लखनऊ",11,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/The+Residency,+Lucknow/@26.8606372,80.9267863,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x399bfd95d4ec4999:0x58b425c3fb30dcca!8m2!3d26.8606372!4d80.9267863!16s%2Fm%2F0h1hb3c?hl=en",21,17,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOXlpkskW02iBirFPSQRuNaCKDLmqbvPikHtrad=w150-h150-k-no-p,19,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNJb8ofVnkvvLnFCIlYNv5AS-qtsjKHuDWFfHma=w1920-h1080-k-no,,15,23,,,0,17,11,21,ChIJmUns1JX9mzkRytww-8MltFg,,6 months ago,Navneet's Photography,51,2022-12-21T02:24:07.455Z,5,People also search for,0,20,,67,19,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNF8jPvjdUYaHS60mYuGhi9508pwDH_-_cFAeIX=w1920-h1080-k-no,,0,9,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPMDrjcGboDS__evst8dTuXn2gtx5BRwsZr9IK9=w150-h150-k-no-p,,0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106065044633645537972?hl=en-US,7,66,,,Ruines of the Buildings @ Residency,57,14,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMwVDDUh16q3US3yyV1_cS_l12S6u33vDa8QPQi=w150-h150-k-no-p,7,0,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM6BL8Xs4XAMdGo4Mw_szAZaWqjU-p7JnK1GB37=w150-h150-k-no-p,0,16,True,23,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMmbZKFmcsq2P3tKqRC_WZry_WeRCBqy2Q5ELFA=w150-h150-k-no-p,False,54,,Tourist attraction,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOCeJHyCIfdwfQ2IHlg7fSGMe3eSlhTR1WiUeBY=w1920-h1080-k-no,64,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPfVVbwi2D2jfuriqIm1CcMTHJO0k00W6riMKAz=w150-h150-k-no-p,7 AM to 6 PM,6,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMg8SYMM9ndiWUiuWg-meCRLfM7_ZUcQ5CXaqPf=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,"One of the best location in the middle of Lucknow city adjacent to High court.
