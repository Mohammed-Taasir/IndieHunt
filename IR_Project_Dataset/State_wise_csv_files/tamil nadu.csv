Lovely climate prevailed....👍

TamilNadu Government should take steps to improve the basic facilities and promote the falls as it has very potential features as a tourist spot.

His consort, Paravati, is known as Panjin Melladi Ammai. The historical name of the place is Keeralathur. This is also famous for pongu sannieswar temple.

History:
Agni was under the hold of ezharai sani when he had missed some of his energy due to the following factors. Agni took part in a yaga performed by Dakshan who was the father-in-law of Lord Shiva. The main objective of performing yaga by Dakshan was to offend Shiva. Agni had also been affected with dosha when the wax palace was burnt with the purpose of destroying the Pandavas. Fire (Agni) interceded with Lord Shiva at this place to return his energy. Lord Shiva gratified him here & therefore known as Agnesswarar. There is a tale behind how this temple is so essential for Saneeswaran praise. Saneeswaran is just a planet that has effects on the individual according to his karmas (deeds). However, individuals misinterpreted and terrifying the very discussion of the name. Ezharai Sani or the 7.50 % period interval when the planet molds its malefic impact on the native of the horoscope is a terrifying periods. In the same way Ashatama Sani is feared. Saneeswaran did not like this and he appealed to the Lord that he should not be blamed accountably or attributed for doing his allocated process. Master Shiva was satisfied with Saneeswaran and conferred him the title Saneeswaran here. No other planet has the tag Easwaran connected. He instructed Saneeswaran to remain at this temple as Pongu Sani and bless the enthusiasts.",,"How many km from kumbakonam

Chakrapani Temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to God Vishnu located in Kumbakonam, Tamil Nadu, India. This temple is located 2 km, away towards North West from the Kumbakonam Railway Station.

Vishnu appears in the form of a discus or Chakra to put down the pride of Surya (the Sun), who subsequently became his devotee. Like Shiva, Lord Chakrapani has a third eye on His forehead. The temple is one of the most prominent temples in Kumbakonam.

The fort is an excellent representation of the rich cultural and architectural heritage of India, with its impressive stone walls, grand entrance gates, and intricate carvings. However, it is unfortunate that the surrounding water bodies have become severely polluted with plastic and other waste, which takes away from the beauty of the area.

It is disappointing that despite its cultural significance and popularity among tourists, the local authorities have not taken sufficient steps to maintain the cleanliness of the surrounding areas. This is likely to deter visitors who are looking for a serene and peaceful environment to explore the rich history of India. The lack of proper waste management systems and the absence of any meaningful efforts to address the pollution issue has resulted in a decline in the appeal of the area to visitors.

While it is understandable that the responsibility for maintaining the cleanliness of the area falls on the local authorities, tourists too have a role to play in preserving the natural beauty of the area. It is important for visitors to be mindful of their waste and to dispose of it properly to help protect the environment.

In conclusion, Vellore Fort is a beautiful and significant historical site that deserves to be preserved and cherished. However, the pollution and littering in the surrounding water bodies detract from its beauty and appeal to tourists.

One of the ancient temples of Shiva.

Renovation work is under process during my visit (Jan 27, 2023). Kumbabhisehgam will in the month of May 2023.
Very Big Shiva & Parvathy (10 feet Ht) in second level (appx 50 steps to reach 2nd level) . It is very amazing & eye catching. 3rd level (Sattanathar/Bairavar inside Shutter Window--appx 20 steps available). It is only one temple with 3 Gods in one place.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The Bhramapureeswarar shrine is housed in the lower level. Brahmapureeswarar is accompanied by Ambal Sthira sundari/Thiripurasundari or Thirunilainayaki in Tamil. The second-level houses Periyanakar with Periyanayaki on a Thoni, hence the name Thoniappar. Sattainathar/Vatukanathar is also housed here. There are 22 water bodies associated with this shrine. Three different forms of Shiva are worshipped here, the Shivalingam (Bhrammapureeswarar), a colossal image of Uma Maheswarar (Toniappar) at the medium level, and Bhairavar (Sattanathar) at the upper level. The temple is associated with the legend of child Sambandar who is believed to have been fed by Parvathi on the banks of the temple tank. The child later went on to compose Tevaram, a Saiva canonic literature on Shiva and became one of the most revered Saiva poets in South India.

Harassment by local stff - Avoidable place, we visited this place in october 2022 in car with family and it was an avoidable experience. Based on this experience we skipped lambs rock ( lamps rock) view point too.

Cons:
1. Congested parking places ( but managed by staff as much as possible) but expect difficulties and minor issues.
2. Harassment and illegally extra parking charges - rs. 50 per whiteboard car ..only rs. 20 for yellow board cars. Unofficial staff employed by local municipal politicians control the place.
3. But the parking receipt is just a local,unofficial  bit notice print without date and time or any detils.
4. No notice board on the point of parking fee collection. They collect fee by stopping cars on middle of the road before 1 km itself. They don't show any notice, circular, board or any offical information or license for parking fee collected. They harass tourists if asked to show info. The board at the dolphins nose is also just a simple flex print without details.

5. The entry cost for going into the view point for adult approx rs. 50 for adult and rs.30 for child. Camera rs.30 per camera. Very costly.

6. Zero maintenance ..the place is not at all maintained. All plastic covers thrown in and around, coco cola, pepsi cool drink cans, cool drink bottles, alcohol bottles thrown in the view point. No cleaning of the spot done by officials.

7. View is good but not worth the 200 rs minimum cost for a family of 3.

8. If you are going as a large group, family easily the cost will cross thousands. Not worth it.

9. One can easily park your car on the road side and enjoy peaceful, clear views from numerous roadside points on the way.

10. The usual bad feeling of being ripped off engulfs you after you visit the place. Better to enjoy mother nature free of cost from various free road side spots.

11. Expect heavy traffic and 20 min to 40 mins stoppages on the way ( one way)  on holidays.  Based on these points and advise from tea shop owners we skipped the nearby lambs rock, lamps rock view point also in coonoor. Not  suitable for large families, groups.

12. Only suitable if you go by bike, two wheelers.

It is located approximately 8km away from Madurai city. The temple is carved inside a rocky hill. If you visit during crowded days, parking might be difficult. A footwear locker is available near the entrance. There is a paid queue for speedy darshan. This ticket also enables you view the idol from near.
There are a few steps to climb on your way to the deity, and the elderly may have a hard time. If you are claustrophobic, this place is best avoided as the queue climbs and winds through some congested spots. Some people may approach you to offer their services as a guide. Caution is advised while dealing with them.

Arulmigu Subramaniya Swamy Temple, Thiruparankundram is one of the beautiful Murugan temple in india. The temple is built in rock-cut architecture and believed to have been built by the Pandyas during the 6th century. According to the legend it is where Murugan slayed the demon Surapadman and married Deivayanai, the divine daughter of the king of heaven, Indra, and he is said to have worshipped Shiva here as Parangirinathar. There are some steps to enter to the temple. The hill view of the temple is very beautiful. There are many small shops and lodges nearby.",,"(Translated by Google) Karthik Deepam Live

But I had never heard of this park earlier. This time, when I was googling , I found out about this and read some great reviews of the park.

When I visited it, my jaw dropped at the unimaginable beauty of the whole place. You have a quaint park set amidst such a spectacular location with hills, waterfalls, railway track, huge trees, tea plantations surrounding it.

The park is maintained extremely well and you find it so joyful to just take a stroll here looking at the supremely beautiful atmosphere.

Its just around 6-7 Km from Coonoor main town on the Mettupalyam road. Don't know if it's a blessing or what looking at the sparse crowd here. But it is just the top spot to visit in Coonoor.

Carry waterbottle and snacks. You may require refreshment while coming back.

As per Hindu legend, once sage Pundarika was performing penance worshiping Vishnu at this place. He collected Tamarasa flowers and submitted it to view Vishnu in Ksirabdhi Natha form, his posture in Tirupaarkadal. He collected 1,008 flowers and in his intensity, he scooped out water also in full. Vishnu came in disguise in the form of sage and asked him for food. The sage went to acquire food for the old man, but while returning he found that Vishnu remained in the place.

There is only a museum where you get a little bit of information. There I a lot to read in the form of posters.

The staffs explain about sun and the black spots on it. Or else there is nothing much.
To reach the museum there is a long walk of approximately 450 meters and overall that effort of walking is a little bit disappointing.

It will be a great place for school going children.

Though there's no known sources of rocks or mountains how the ancestors made it possible?

There are 1212 pillars in the world famous 3rd Prakaram. Can't imagine how they did it.

Now a days vehicular traffic is restricted near the temple. So plan your visit accordingly.

There are too many different sizes of food stalls/restaurants around the Temple. You will never go hungry.

For the 22 holy Theertha snanam (holy bath) don't accept what the touts say about the charges. Learn to bargain and start from 50% and you may settle at 60 -70% rate.

Don't leave the wet cloths inside the temple. There's no literature asking the devotees to leave their wet cloths inside the temple. This only makes the place more humid.

Don't buy any souvenirs inside the Temple. Exorbitant price and you have to carry it for long time. Outside the Temple you have too many options. Choose WISELY.

We used to visit the falls whenever we went to kolli hills,

🚗🚘🏍️🚲Earlier there is no bike and car parking seperately, recently they did some correction on land and made a  paid parking , but we can park our vehicles in road side itself,

It's worth falls to visit with family and friends

⛱️🏤🎽👚👔👗👘🥻🩱👙🩳🩲🧥🥼There is a dress changing room available for both men and women ,but mostly men's dress changing rooms would be locked by management

🍜🍫🍻🍺☕🍵There are few snacks shops available on the road side, hot noodles, bread omelet, chips  soft drinks and tea

🍌🍍🌽🥔🫒You will natively grow fruits available such as pineapple, Banana, orange and many based on season

But please be careful during the bath at falla because there would be bottles broken by some idiots

Actually we visited this falls for new year 2023 with my cousin brothers

Important points to take note:
1. Be prepared for a climb up and down steep stairs of about 250. For those with knee/joint pains and elderly people, it is not advisable to go. You can reach the falls within 20mins. But climbing up will be the hardest, will need few breaks in between.
2. Parking charges of 50rs for cars and 10 or 15rs for bikes.
3. Better bring your own water bottles since the hike can be tiring.

Poondi is a small village located near Tirukattupalli in Thiruvaiyaru Taluk (also spelled as Taluka), about 35 km away from Thanjavur. Poondi is usually associated with Alamelupuram village located besides the Basilica and so is called as Poondi-Alamelupuram, officially.

Poondi is a small hamlet sandwiched between the rivers Cauvery and Coleroon Alamelupuram. Poondi is believed to have got its name from Poondu, a shrub in Tamil, which grew in abundance here earlier. The hamlet is significant thanks to the renowned Poondi Madha Shrine (The Shrine of Our Lady of Poondi).

Poondi Madha Shrine is an important pilgrim spot for Roman Catholics and is almost as famous as Velankanni, which is also in Tamilnadu. Thousands of devout worshippers from across India throng to this church with an unshakeable belief that their prayers will be answered. The church is an imposing and elegant building and stands tall and proud; you can’t miss it from a distance because its tall towers reach out to the sky.

Rev. Fr. Constantine Joseph Beschi S.J., popularly known as Veeramamunivar an Italian Jesuit missionary and Tamil Scholar, built the Church of Mary Queen of Immaculate Conception between 1714 and 1718. Poondi Madha Shrine was officially classified a Minor Basilica by Pope John Paul II on 3 August, 1999. Veeramamunivar authored many Tamil literary works including the famous Thembaavani and Paramartha Guru Kadhai. He holds a special place in Tamil culture and the Tamil Nadu government has honored him by erecting his statue on the popular Marina Beach.

Within the dome of the church is the statue of the miraculous Lady of Poondi. This extraordinary statue is one of the three statues that were completed in France after the apparition of Our Lady at Lourdes and was brought to India by Rev. Father Darres. According to available records when the French Missionary Fathers (MEP Fathers) where taking care of the Pastrol Mission in Kumbakonam Diocese, Father Mette Louis Jules started a Catechetical School in Poondi around the year 1900 to train Catechetics.

The Holy Mother appeared to Bernadette in 1858 in Lourdes in France. Statues of Our Lady of Lourdes were sent to different parts of the World. Out of the three statues that came to India, one was brought to and remains in the Poondi Shrine. This statue is so unique, that while looking at it, one gets a feeling of looking at a live person. Since the time the statue was installed in the church, a mysterious brightness has been filling up the entire church during night time. People started special devotion to Our Lady and several miracles started happening here, which continue till day.

Rev.Fr.Lourdes Xavier after being appointed as Parish Priest of Poondi on 1st September 1955 gave immediate attention to improve the condition of the Church, the central roof of which was in a bad condition and it was feared that it might collapse at any moment causing great damage. So he consulted an engineer. They wanted to demolish only the central roof without any damage to the front elevation, the doom and the altar. Fr.Lourdes Xavier was worried as it would cost too much and it would be beyond his means to find the necessary funds to reconstruct the Church.Not having sufficient funds to carry out the repairs, he fasted and prayed to the Holy Mother for 15 days. On the 15th day morning, he heard an inner voice and told the people that the front portion of the church would come down on its own by that afternoon. Exactly as he said, the building collapsed. This happened on 22nd November, 1956 and the reconstruction was completed by 2nd May 1964. This is vividly remembered and described by people even today.",,Is the church rooms available,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNbkPaFyo2dwKAj7Pdp1KSVXf4zfa59iAKez4dP=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105970508488601452361?hl=en-US,holy place,11,0,0,3,,,,,,"https://www.google.com/maps/search/tamil+nadu+places+to+visit/@11.30866,77.2501723,8z/data=!4m2!2m1!6e1?hl=en",,,5,35,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNiIw7IOux2OPY86RBvQK101d5qWKPIwRQKBtDl=w150-h150-k-no-p,True,8,"Big church.

No issues with parking space at all.

You can enjoy zip line over the lake, horse ride along the lake, take selfies with rabbit and boating can be done.
