The cruise is good, best part about it is open deck. You can enjoy sea and it's vastness from the open deck.

But service is not good, we arrived early at jetty, there was no staff to attend us.
They don't even have organised desk place like other cruises to check in.
Ferry was late which is fine but no proper information was given.

K. Moorthy, the  Proprietor & Manager of S.M.S Tours & Travels - Andaman Sightseeing, took personal care from planning to execution of our trip to Andaman within a short notice of only 4 days. He customised our tour keeping in mind every requirement of my little child and my wife with her severely arthritic knees and limited mobility capabilities. His patience, politeness, punctual and informative nature are the perfect qualities expected from a travel management guide. The quality of stay arrangements made and vehicular service provided during the tour made our tour very comfortable and smooth. His caring attitude and warmth made us feel like we were visiting a relative's place.

The value received for money spent during the tour was  much more when compared to cheaper alternatives. I and my family  convey our sincere thanks to Mr. Moorthy for making our trip memorable in all respects. We wish him and his organization the very best in the coming years and a prosperous future.

There was utmost honesty,sincerity and care in every day planned journey with a lot of detailing and briefing done everyday and they made the best plans for us to enjoy our trip

Fully justified for the price paid,it was a Paisa vasool trip by making the most of Andaman,it's natural beauty and us though being vegetarians they took care of our daily meals to guide us appropriately

You can blindly trust Devbrata and book trip with him ,and be most assured that you will have the best time of your life

Thankyou so much Platinum tours for giving us an unforgettable experience from your local guidance and planning and I would highly recommend anyone visiting Andaman to go with them

Visit early morning to view the beautiful sunrise! Usually during the mornings the tides were slightly high and the shore was not visible. However in the mid-afternoon to evenings, the sea water goes inside thus paving way for clean shore. You can walk on the shores and take some awesome pictures. You will get to see sand ripples (ripple marks left by waves) as you walk along the shore. Enjoy sometime over there watching the Havelock island from this beach!

On the way to this beach, there's a teeny-tiny post office located. We decided to send post/letter to our home for souvenir purpose and did the same. You can send it to your family/friends and you can also encourage your kids to do the same. It was a nostalgic moment when the letter got delivered.",,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNUtRsBJbtuE0CPTK0szoPKJG_a2Pc4E0fmfAOd=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,20,,11.8261573,21,0,,,,,,,,,

In one of those islands, on the southern end lies the Little Andaman Island. Famed to be the fourth largest island of the archipelago, it whole-heartedly welcomes tourism yet is not very touristy when compared to the other neighboring islands.

On the natural front, the Little Andaman Island is one-of-a-kind which promises elongated stretches of azure waters, arrays of pristine beaches with unworldly waves, and scenic waterfalls with hubs of picturesque hideouts. Apart from the bounty of nature, Little Andaman Island is also ideal for budget tourists who could easily find pocket-friendly food options, twinned with dirt-cheap rates of alcohol, and of course not to forget the hygienic budgeted beachside or sea-facing accommodation, in the amicable company of the island people.

The local ethnicity of the Little Andaman Island is mostly comprised of a good number of Bengalis, Tamilians, and native aboriginal tribes known as the Onge tribe who have been inhabiting the jungles of Little Andaman since 1957. These jungles of the Onge natives are located reasonably far off from the prying touristy confinements. Apart from the ethnic diversity, Little Andaman is also unique in its biodiversity which is fairly spread between thickets, dense rainforests and long stretches of chromatic beaches and vivid coral reefs that are overly rich in marine life which includes a variety of rare species of marine turtles and a lot more.

The Little Andaman Island is also home to the Little Andaman Lighthouse which is occasionally referred to as the Richardson's Lighthouse. Beyond that, some of the other most popular highlights of the Little Andaman Island stand out to be the thrilling adventure activities like surfing, coral viewing, boating through creeks, and elephant lumbering just to name a few!Ideally, Little Andaman Island is an ideal hotspot for anyone who is up for adventures by the beach.

So you can avoid this place.",,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO0R17EOkiMhcNGJpLS-FP-yr2Yjklk1sbqQcSR=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPcGEzQkZ3EAE,,,,,,,tribes,Baratang,,6 months ago,,,,"Baratang Island, Andaman - Things to Do, Hotels & more",https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNEQZ1euQFIss0l_3Lpm_9uoyGLSJU2dybqFMrk=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110423713505881998367?hl=en-US,2023-03-31T08:00:05.628Z,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5RSDsI3qYzcz8kay6YgKS1OBU-QbfKxZ1NjqHG_BA=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4-br100,,,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPOIqIUIdlyps6ldpzwo_hNNJ8CBqu1Ic5RMT0I=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,2022-09-19T08:35:24.835Z,True,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109405591353556198619,,,,,,Andaman and Nicobar Islands,,,,,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPw02Qd2es85_mZNRsO69kdzKDYs2JoEHiFHa0=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNeMY7ElBZVAKFGwU8T3cWFo634BUhEGrKblgFd=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,,,11,,,,bus,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMwlirLrv2Q6rR-DR-tZVzkdSHBAN-FC8yJZ6j5=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMkjwMdrvKK9hgDivAGKkMQAggle56EON8tn9Op=w1920-h1080-k-no,,What is the time to enter the place,,,,"1 of the Andaman Islands, Baratang offers mangrove creeks, beaches, limestone caves & a mud volcano.",,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPGoFOFvUkoG779UMjgRmHg_sWAU--0l93wDR39=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,ChIJQ9uyAPiJjzARehhncarEU8w,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2 weeks ago,,23,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPdShWSU0L63Na9Qr4IuB82icKfVsVVLlSBiqzw=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,"https://www.google.com/maps/search/andaman+and+nicobar+islands+places+to+visit/@11.8864096,91.6513234,8z/data=!3m1!4b1?hl=en",,,,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Baratang/@12.1884784,92.8140512,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x308f89f800b2db43:0xcc53c4aa7167187a!8m2!3d12.2113936!4d92.8111645!16zL20vMDduZ3Ni?hl=en",,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMgZiCZcaLMLqNARjp71eOtMS7osAmKM9j2Yu6w=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,"Baratang Island is an untarnished beauty in Andaman & Nicobar in 2022 decked up with mangrove creeks, active mud-volcanoes, and limestone ...",,,,,jungle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,speed boat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,28,,,,,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMz4h_j3i7pgmSHk2wuoTMcN0C8oPgjZeoanC2Q=w1920-h1080-k-no,,22,,"You have to go through jarawa reserve forest  to reach baratang  first convoy starts 6 hrs  from jirkatang check post  then 9, 12 & 15 hrs  convoy will not stop anywhere inside jarawa reserve photography strictly prohibited ",https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNwi379U2suwFDYRUdNkmEZqYKBdHp-GEZ1Q9ND=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,8,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM8tbBCTJqKFngBXiTS1x1AkRqP0cX1TvyWMZnN=w1920-h1080-k-no,,10,False,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109039976173718938832?hl=en-US,,,,,,True,,,The best and most convenient way to reach Baratang is by hiring a private vehicle/car or a private AC bus.

We started to Baratang around 3:30 in the morning as it takes around 4 to 5 hours to reach. You will be asked for id proofs at a check post, so keep it handy. The vehicles move one after the other slowly so that we do not disturb the Jarawa forest/ecosystem. On the way to Baratang island, you will stop some 2 or 3 times for refreshments. Small eateries and clean toilets are available. However, we recommend packing food from the hotel you stay in.

As you travel through the forest, you will reach a ferry point where you have to take the ferry (This ferry takes both passengers and vehicles. This ride to the speedboat jetty is also awesome. You can either sit inside the ferry or go to the upper deck and enjoy the island views) to reach Baratang speed boat Jetty. From there you take the speed boat which travels through the mangrove forest to reach the limestone caves. The speed boat journey through the mangrove forest is mesmerizing and on the way, you get to see the huts of Jarawa tribes, and if you are lucky you can spot them too from your speed boat.

Once you reach the starting point of the limestone caves, you get down from the speed boat and start to walk for about 1.5 to 2 km to reach the limestone caves. One of the guides who accompany you in the speed boat will also walk along with you to the limestone caves. Wear comfortable shoes as the walkway is not proper all the time.

Once you reach the limestone caves, you will see all kinds of stunning limestone formations. The area inside the caves is pitch dark so make sure to turn on the flashlight. Take some good pictures and walk back to the speed boat which will bring you back to the ferry point.

Visit limestone caves as early as possible so that you will be the first person to go and take some undisturbed pictures. The area of caves that are open to the public is very small hence you feel overcrowded if few more people arrive. When we went, we were the first people to reach the limestone caves.

You can also visit Mud Volcano from there. Board a cab at Baratang Jetty and it takes around 10 to 15 mins to reach the spot from there again you need to walk a little while to view the mud volcano.

You can also visit Parrot Island from here. Just inquire with your cab driver. Once all done, take the ferry back to the point from where you arrived and ride back to your hotel in your cab.",,3 years ago,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOSH3aJWMezC9rgYaObzTCjlgufof5ziMHbkZdy=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,,,20,,12.2113936,83,6,,,,,,,,,

The best time is to go at sunset. They have plenty of shops near the beaches to have some light snacks. I won't prefer to swim there as it's a very rocky beach. You need to park your vehicle at a parking point and walk a few metres to the beach.

Location :- Known as Ross island earlier, this small island is now known as Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Island. Accessible through boat with a 5-10 min ride.

How to reach :- This island is accessible only through Boat and not by road transport. Tickets are available through private tour operators who are widely located at Marina Biological Park. From this point the jetty begins, also known as Aberdeen Jetty. The trip includes ticket to North Bay islands and then to Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Island and then back to Port Blair. The sequence may change. The ticket cost is INR 770.

About the place :- The place was used by British Empire as their capital. They had a full sustained setup of all the facilities here which included a swimming pool, mess and recreational facilities, water treatment plant and beautiful residences.
They even got deers on the island and due to non existence of any predator their population is increasing unchecked at the island.
Presently food items are banned at the island and only one food restaurant is available. There is a souvenir shop here. The area is well laid out and there are electric vehicle for sightseeing at a nominal price of  INR 80 and people can make use of it.

Facilities :- Drinking water is available through RO plant and water is free of charge from it. There is water available for purchase as well. Washrooms are available and as described earlier electric  vehicles are also available.

Sight seeing :- Lot of places to see as described above and in addition they even had a printing press and there is a light house which is on the other side of the island and accessible by walk as the e rickshaw drop you 300 meters short of the light house.
The place is very clean and as a family you can have a good time amongst the Deers as they are very friendly. Remember do not feed them and do not trouble them.
There is a Naval station here but no restrictions for tourists.

Important tips :- Take a small boat from PortBlair as it is easier to manage less people as compared to large boat where in number of  passengers is more and will cause delay in boarding and dismounting as well.
- Do not feed the Deers and no eatables on the islands.
- There is a time limit of 1 hr for visiting Netaji Subhash Island and post this your boat will be waiting for you at the ferry point.",,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOIMMp_Aq8guAVKwnVJScp7Y1iBKUatqS_Uq_eu=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1elBEWnJnRRAB,,,,,,,indian navy,"Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Island, Port Blair",,4 months ago,,,,Ross Island ( Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Island),https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipODN5XjG__HWNr0rCRjxkJP3-LYDAzdrhwt1F14=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111334314873492604724?hl=en-US,2023-03-31T08:04:23.737Z,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5SKlq7TOI-Z3FnKBNuC7fbE3z_YNWPBE8vQxKMpwA=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4-br100,,8 AM to 5 PM,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNdLeZlikL4ABr7n7cVFirmQ8DIXe78BXmVTCXb=w150-h150-k-no-p,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNnXYCFGGK-7HyunMXIAkjMlUnIgGmUcTI8JJ4-=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,2022-11-09T10:25:43.521Z,True,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100076180200392140835,,,,,,Andaman and Nicobar Islands,,,,,,,,5,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNxusDc66-st_DGk-Oz1ab-86JfUTw_x4-SBvMF=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMJOjU3aXkl2KkMdoCvU2I-2tSFOQdVNjE-ambV=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,,,12,,,,subhas bose,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNQDp1H2Xl8rYUUg0mtVDwF0Ny50bVGrGidTK6-=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,4.6,,,,,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO-nZIJdIgUsht0A4nxA8QEWT0Qs3o9wys0M7NM=w1920-h1080-k-no,,What is the entry ticket for Ross Island?,,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNd1hVTib0HOY-CGpQ7r_Oq-I6OePzZSmgUdha-=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,ChIJXxZFSUGViDARULFL_fVeor4,False,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104090120978079666677?hl=en-US,,8 AM to 5 PM,Sunday,,,,,,,,2 months ago,,27,,MQG7+438,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMEUI_rwxIZeAW86mvkvvAyshXjHPFsc3fjDTg5=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOEikGk0JSISgdTFmJsqJXllXDkDelv8fU7tEAp=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMiPY6ldXmBTs9wQNkI3_gmuhaxxeunRgVw48Kn=w150-h150-k-no-p,,"https://www.google.com/maps/search/andaman+and+nicobar+islands+places+to+visit/@11.8864096,91.6513234,8z/data=!3m1!4b1?hl=en",8 AM to 5 PM,,,,,,,Other,,,,,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Netaji+Subhash+Chandra+Bose+Island,+Port+Blair/@11.6752953,92.7627011,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x308895414945165f:0xbea25ef5fd4bb150!8m2!3d11.6752953!4d92.7627011!16s%2Fg%2F11df0z1v2k?hl=en",https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMwJCeLgC0nC26J3bDqKvGJ6LB380YX20nSoF_T=w150-h150-k-no-p,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMvrJCth9LI1zZkuXND8o8Xo5vL27rW4-jh3COy=w1920-h1080-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPkXNbZBQujY9GZ4CUZsLf2TWXyRNH64t64SSm8=w150-h150-k-no-p,,People also search for,"How to Reach : · The Veer Savarkar Airport, an International Airport is located in the capital town of Port Blair, the gateway to Andaman and Nicobar Islands.",,,,,electric vehicle,,,Wonderful palace,,,,,,,,,,,,,bunkers,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM11SGGv9FSIleEyBJQoNHDbNHhstqW4T_d-Ppp=w150-h150-k-no-p,Siddharth Khamesra,,,,,,,,,,,,28,,MQG7+438,,,,,,,True,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO_Uu2V8lYKsqbpkcQpJGHSH8JJ9QW7UJ4g2I48=w1920-h1080-k-no,,20,, Rs. 30 per person. ,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOJLFjRWEITAq_v6Dp8rpKGKFTeWOBuawGqHYBw=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,10,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP71xtrWXu4jMXP_9MVCvwWbbZ4zDnr-6sH-Szt=w1920-h1080-k-no,,1,True,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110096767439150882486?hl=en-US,,,,,,True,,,"Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Island (Ross Island) ...

Too big to explore the ruins of british colonial occupation in an hour or so your ship docks here and too empty of any attractions which may last in your memory.

It used to be an British army-barracks island and then the buildings were shattered by earthquake of 1941, vegetation was scorched by Japanese mortar shells and in 2004 a tsunami continued the wreckage.

The leftover of the tragic history is a made up island that has affectionate does and deers as residents and makeshift patches of coconut trees. You buy seats of an open seater to travel towards the lighthouse, and see a bunch of worn out army encampments along the way.

On reaching there lies a hell of a lot of downwards stairs to cross. Then you go past a wooden bridge over the ocean and gaze at the pretty lighthouse and admire it's longevity. And it's about time to hastily rush back and catch your ferry for North Bay.

It is by any means lovely looking destination, though I prefer Baratang over it because BT is more naturally special ( first thing you see on NJSCBI is a renovated Japanese Bunker).

Ross & Smith Islands requires forest permit from the Forest Office at Diglipur. The permission costs Rs 50 for Indian tourists and Rs 500 for foreign tourists and can be obtained on all days (except Sunday) between 6am to 2pm. A fisherman’s boat (‘dinghi’ in hindi) or a speed boat can be hired and the ride would take around 25 mins from the Ariel Bay Jetty in Diglipur.

What makes these islands truly beautiful and sets them apart from the rest of the islands is that these two islands are joined by a natural, sand bar. Water is crystal clear and gem green in color. Sun bathing in Ross & Smith Islands is a wonderful experience. During high tide, the sand bar disappears leaving a trail of water between the two islands and during low tide the sand bar appears again making the islands look majestic! There is a Marine Sanctuary on the island which makes it an ideal place for spotting beautiful coral reefs and colorful species from the underwater. The beach is surrounded by tropical forests and is a preferred place for trekking and trail hiking by many tourists. One can also opt for activities like Scuba Diving & Snorkeling. The clear blue waters add a touch of cleanliness to the whole experience.

The beach is very crowded and your pocket will burn if you're on a budget trip.

It was already late in the morning so we decided to take the boat to elephant beach than do the trek (should have just done that). Boat costs 1000/head which includes complimentary snorkeling. Even if somebody doesn't want to go snorkeling, you have to pay the full amount. And they said 5 minutes and will  reach the first marker on the water.

The moment you arrive at the beach, a guide will come to brief you about the island, which he does in 20seconds and spends the rest of the time talking about paying extra 600 rs (apart from the 1000 we paid for boat) for 10 minutes of snorkeling and photos.

They have changing rooms and lockers which are 20-50rs and cut fruit stalls all which we skipped.

We went for the complimentary snorkeling and the guy started pitching to give 300rs for the additional time which we declined. He gave a half mask which was useless as water kept getting inside. Again he started to give 300 per head pitch to use the full mask which he declined. Boy! He was not happy and finished the snorkeling within 40-60seconds and went to the next team. I think it's better to buy your own snorkeling mask and go if you know swimming, lol.

It's all privatized so there's no cap on the rates or anybody to monitor the services they provide. I can understand their income from tourists only last for 6-7 monsoons as everything is shut during monsoons.

3. There is an entry fee. 50/- per head. 20/- for scooter.

4. Once you enter the park, there are multiple view points. We liked the one at the end which gave a panoramic view. And the silence if no visitors around was awesome. Very under rated destination.
