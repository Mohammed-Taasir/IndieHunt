The name Porcupine Point is originated from the bird Porcupine as the shape of the place is identical to the shape of the Porcupine bird.

This spot offers the ideal view of sunset and also gives the majestic view of distant Prabalgad fort. Additional attraction of the Porcupine Point is the famous Cathedral Rocks positioned to the west of the Sunset Point. The location is blessed with scenic surroundings and dense forests. The calm and cool atmosphere mesmerizes the travelers.

This place is mostly visited in the evening hours to watch the sunset. The place can be accessed by walk or horse, but walking is the preferred mode of reaching this place. It can also be accessed from Dhodani village and this trail offers wonderful views.

The place is very big and very well-directed. The entry fee is rs 20 for adults and 10 for kids. There were various sections where the animals were kept. There was the aquarium, snake corner, cages, and fields for birds and animals. Most of the animals were out of their small rooms during our visit. We could see tigers, porcupines, monkeys, different types of deer, foxes, nilgai, leopard, crocodiles, rabbits, Emu, many types of fishes, birds, and various snakes. There was a museum that depicted the Maratha's history. There were big parks around for children and adults to play, exercise, chit-chat, and relax.
We had loads of fun in the park. We sat on the swings.
Areas to work on- Towards the end of the zoo there is a food corner that was not that clean, the washroom was also not clean but they were charging rs 5 per person.

This temple's Ganpati idol was inaugurated and donated by the ""Khollam"" family, a goldsmith family based in Ranjangaon. The temple was built between the 9th and 10th century. The main temple looks like it was built in the Peshwa period. Nagarkhana is situated above the entrance gate. The temple facing east has huge and beautiful entrance gate.

Madhavrao Peshwa made a room in the basement of the temple to keep the idol of lord Ganesh. Later on Sardar Kibe of Indore renovated it. The idol of these lord Ganesh is also named as 'Mahotkat', and it is said that the idol has 10 trunks and 20 hands.
While going from the Pune - Nagar highway the route is Pune - Koregaon - then via Shikrapur; Rajangaon is 21 km before Shirur. From Pune it is 50 km.
In early 1990s, Govt of Maharashtra established an industrial zone (MIDC) on the land acquired from the nearby villages and the industrial establishment is known as Ranjangaon MIDC.

AC cafeteria is average, needs to be improved a lot. Washrooms are clean though, totally unexpected in govt places like this one. Bird park is a treat for bird lovers. Professional cameramen will get their tickets worth here. There's just one tiger, which is huge, but only if you are lucky, and if you get a place to watch through glass.

Amboli Ghat is a mountain pass in the Sahyadri. The hill station of Amboli lies on this ghat. It’s on the way from Kolhapur to Sawantwadi. This ghat receives heavy rainfall and is surrounded by thick forest, waterfalls and beautiful natural landscape. This ghat is one of the tourist attractions in Maharashtra.Quiet and isolated, Amboli is a perfect hill station for those who really want to get away from the hustle and bustle of city life. Situated at an altitude of 690 m, Amboli lies in the Sindhudurg district of South Maharashtra. Also known as the Cherrapunji of Maharashtra, Amboli is the last mountain resort before the coastal plains begin. On one side of Amboli lies the Konkan coast, the other three flanked by handsome looking valleys.

Best time to visit this place is during the monsoon.
*the perfect spot for a one day picnics.
Make sure you carry your own food & water as no shops are close by. The trek is about 20-25mins to the bottom of the waterfall, but if you hike for another 10-15mins you would reach the top of the waterfall and get an overview of the city. There is also a pond of water when you get up. You can sit and relax while the streams pass you.
We r completely left to ourselves to protect in any emergency.

It is a beautiful lake however there were no facilities apart from a restaurant (didn't go inside however it is right on the banks of the lake and maybe they have toilet facilities There) and some street food even toilets were not avaliable. To arrive here you drive past the Kaas plateau gates and follow the jungle road down the mountain with many blind turns where if you are in your own vehicle please honk to alert others. The road is paved but in bad condition. Overall worth visiting be warned that you may get better pictures from the hill slopes rather than the lake itself.

The Ovalekar wadi has been maintained as a family home and Mr. Rajendra Ovalekar has grown a variety of butterfly host and nectar plants. He takes care of his plants very fondly. His patient efforts for the last several years, have turned this place into a butterfly home. There are a number of plant for butterflies to feed and lay eggs.

The garden is open on Sundays 9 AM to 12.30 PM. The best time to visit are just after monsoon (August-September), but if you visit any other times you can surely see up to 20-30 butterfly species and their early stages. It is advised to come soon so that you can make the most of your time and take pictures. If you are lucky you can also see Blue Mormon here, the state butterfly of Maharashtra, which we saw today on our visit.

There is an orientation lecture which covers basic aspects of butterfly life cycle, enriched with his personal gardening experiences. He has vast knowledge about plants, butterflies and associated insects, which he passionately shares with everyone. Butterfly activities such as puddling, courtship, fruit-baiting, oviposition can be regularly spotted here. Visitors can participate in the day-to-day gardening activities such as weeding, mulching, seed collection. This experience is very enriching for school-children and elders alike. This is garden which the whole family can enjoy.
Ovalekar wadi can be easily reached using public and private transport. The garden has basic restroom facilities and a comfortable public sitting area. It is advised to carry sufficient drinking water and your own food items, especially if you have small children with you. Please make sure to maintain the garden as it is and not to litter or damage any plants/insects. Like any nature outing one has to be patient while watching butterflies and be mindful of weather conditions. The place is generally safe being a private property, but care needs to be taken and one should avoid getting into deep vegetation. Also avoid touching/consuming any plant parts without knowledge.
The place is definitely recommended for a Sunday outing and you will be inspired to start your own butterfly garden. You will keep going back here!!",,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO456iTMmnqURyGrFxiLOzsD6b_H73HPDn4Tkc_=w1920-h1080-k-no,december,,,,,,,,Ovalekar Wadi Butterfly Garden attraction reviews - Trip.com,,,,,,11,,eggs,,,8,,,Wednesday,,,,,4.1,Thursday,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOCl1gVKtF7MPkd_25h7f_ZjVqDB3Z57W0oEcKp=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,Monday,,,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPzRlW0Na8JkAfi-5-eeKAjm-mNaM-y33IbfhkM=w150-h150-k-no-p,4.3,,,24,,,,,,,,,,,"7XC4+25C, Ovalekar Wadi,Owala Village,Takkarda Road, Ghodbunder Rd, Thane, Maharashtra 400607, India",,3357,,,False,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPh4Pvyl5phKAyMcArFupLjpFIeuNgATZzc5Mjl=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,,Elvis Garden,,,True,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPozAAJrQhaIouzCzqFrS1sinxEiSJvB4SOaRSN=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,2023-03-17T18:47:29.931Z,,,ओवळेकर वाडी बटरफ्लाय गार्डन,,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ovalekar+Wadi+Butterfly+Garden/@19.2700734,72.9553997,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x3be7bbaf373d0f4f:0xe272320891a35a3a!8m2!3d19.2700734!4d72.9553997!16s%2Fg%2F1vvywjyy?hl=en",,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOvrX54X3gQ3vPfADS3gvwlFKnyEYMGHR2OIp8K=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNDh8kPJoNFoxKlRVD20OjqpJT8UZotrhE7lRHV=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,,,,7,,,,ChIJTw89N6-75zsROlqjkQgycuI,,3 months ago,Niteen ..,,2023-01-17T16:57:15.398Z,5,,People also search for,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOvLfe_P3GoL6WyCh5XJ53eEc1oKGWFIJ7SRmEx=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOBZy2AhU4IzcRVqAD1sZy333Vf-vjsAiGX2S95=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102500100863552200999?hl=en-US,,,,Upvan Lake Garden,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOVxzhHfAcZazBG0LaYfPLBIlncM9YOvWFhsu0b=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,True,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN4lWKP1vmNEadSEauUVlnfh00VE5x6t39wvZTF=w150-h150-k-no-p,False,33,Tourist attraction,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNSx5QefzvRb4YwQw7321vuDc689KM9dr8y0eaO=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,8 AM to 1 PM,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO65CIoMTPkGdKjLu8r1Y313bQl0pR8i_PKkrwy=w1920-h1080-k-no,,True,"An Isolated & quiet place in ghodbandar road.

We were taken the day pass which costs 1500 per person with 50 activities included in it.

There are more than 20 in door activities included in those 50 so it really disappointed us. Also on weekends the crowd is more and for every activity there is a long waiting queue so it really takes your patience away. As part of this day pass they should give the two or more paid activities so that it will benefit their publicity. In my opinion they have kept so many activities in a small area so the people sits more in the waiting queue.

The food rates are also high but the food quality is not very good with less varieties in one of the restaurant where we had the lunch. The infrastructure they have set up is very attractive. The small children wil love the place.

Overall I would rate the place as 3.8 out of 5 stars.",,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNPAMEU1qeQikGC2GN4UpWesZPRgJAwpnJ-JhU7=w1920-h1080-k-no,villas,,,27,,,0,0,Passes - Della Adventure,,44,,0,16,34,Amusement park,carrom,,,23,47,,Wednesday,,,,0,3.7,Thursday,0,,14,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOghvTW0ywAy-1KdnYkX4o5VYMaTyKEjbUumSax=w150-h150-k-no-p,18,12,12,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP9ndOtg5Q-8DfmhELQvkcrs4__uMxVXYZxVLyx=w150-h150-k-no-p,Monday,,9,11,,,87,,,4.3,,,104,0,8,16,,0,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPYZ08E7yAqtYv4J5Dzml_XiueJckGF-1JRhAw4=w150-h150-k-no-p,18,60,0,,"Plot No. 130-1, Lonavala, Kunegaon, Maharashtra 410401, India",,27331,0,0,False,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMzV0C4vCj00vXskgt4ZvJQs0Y1TNRmfgauIM3l=w1920-h1080-k-no,10,0,8,,Della Resorts,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNzInBGDS5q1XxGSqbiO7bpt1jlt67g9NVLn5dC=w1920-h1080-k-no,46,0,2023-03-17T18:54:10.045Z,18,,डेला ऍडव्हेंचर पार्क,11,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Della+Adventure+Park/@18.7814023,73.38906,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x3be800c384e0d86f:0x7dc9c8794789297b!8m2!3d18.7814023!4d73.38906!16s%2Fg%2F1hdzg0h4d?hl=en",21,17,,19,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN1_5ozf5ofMSm_ivuJlAVAYndqybeAXqL5ilxB=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,15,23,,,18,0,0,21,ChIJb9jghMMA6DsReymJR3nIyX0,,2 months ago,vaibhavi shah,30,2023-01-18T16:53:13.723Z,4,0,People also search for,20,,69,19,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO3gsbRCaLE2qNkZpZXuYWduC9O4G92QAUI5AVs=w1920-h1080-k-no,,0,9,,,75,7,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116503735850060653060?hl=en-US,38,,,Della Villas,37,14,,True,,7,0,,0,16,True,23,,,,False,113,Tourist attraction,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPbKJIxSy7diXltOHk6w8VqEPhub-TuNyEjk4Mh=w1920-h1080-k-no,28,,11 AM to 7 PM,6,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMvIvZVXVFgaKsimJiwQgOSXTfwU-u_MJh8LWLW=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,"The best place to visit with family and friends! 😍
There are many activities for children as well as adults.
Park time is 9.00am to 9.00pm.
There are multiple pass types available according to your choice of sports.
Major adventure activities are chargeable and not cheap.
You can enjoy cycle ride, in-house virtual games and rifle shooting, archery and cricket for free.
Overall the best place to visit to make your day more adventurous..🔥
The food quality is also amazing you'll get both veg and non-veg food items for lunch.

Try to avoid visiting this place at weekends as there will be a rush at the park and because of that you'll have to wait for almost 20-30 mins for each activity.
As per my guess you'll not be able to enjoy every ride if you are visiting here at the weekend.

There's an open ground at the base of the hill, so ample parking available. There's a washroom before you start climbing the hill, no facilities in the caves, so be mindful.

The caves sit atop the hill, the stairs lead to them. The panaromic view of the city from the top is gorgeous.

Like all rock cut places, this cave also has a calming, chill feel to it. The caves are not lit, so the main attraction - the massive Buddha statue with the disciples - sits in dark. I'd have really appreciated if there were a few guides who'd explain the carvings on the walls. Some of them did get spike my curiosity.

Clearly, there's been a lot of patch work done to make it tourist friendly. But nonetheless, it's a nice place to visit and spend a couple of hours.",,,,Other,,,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPtck0l31WQyaM-X3glzDnPbG4W-2o_1prZDNAz=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,,,,,a month ago,,Maharashtra,,

Soneri Mahal was built by a Bandalkand chief who accompanied Aurangzeb into the Dakhan. The Mahal was built between 1651 AD and 1653 AD at a cost of Rs.50, 000 and in 1934 AD it was sold to the Nizam of Hyderabad for Rs.26, 400. The Mahal is named after the paintings in the palace that were once painted in gold.",https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMZqErAhxIXBMu_d0T6DW7Mgb8WvblbMMH8Mohe=w1920-h1080-k-no,Friday,artifacts,1773,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMqeUVVz2qoIl3te4nlBnCAMoIiEalIIPoqDvU=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,131,,19,,3.6,W845+MG4,,True,,16,57,0,,55,1176,11,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOY3DKt5WJKZXAKfiHOqkQJF89jN_DJCHMiXowZ=w150-h150-k-no-p,,1,0,23,0,,,,15,,,1,,,0,10,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMUP7ZQRa5mfzZ-osFkxArRDzaZrhRe04XanEn3=w1920-h1080-k-no,,People also search for,,,431004,8,,,0,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMxJBUQfTtgMScnqByCy9h5gAWrKtCsf5TTqVSM=w1920-h1080-k-no,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACB-R5S7IseCFwLs66bTw3LtUHpVNUGQjBc0KIkUTMw5=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4-br100,22,7,16,,,"Located 2 kilometres from the infamous Bibi Ka Maqbara and about 6 kilometres from the Aurangabad Railway Station, is the last remaining Palace in the city, ...",9,True,13,,45,,0,,0,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPhkKYBg-79kQwGBuStjvHSwNUcf8prT0saKDXw=w1920-h1080-k-no,,0,0,,41,,61,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPS0IP6x9LxxIt5vPkLKgW1uaalGZvUBbS6D5hn=w150-h150-k-no-p,102,11,university,3,0,,22,45,,63,,museum,32,,"(Translated by Google) who made soneri mahal

The temple is actually a great example of Hemadpanti art form of temple from those days. Made up mostly with black and red stones.
It has a specious entry which leads then in to few steps , taking you directly to the Lord shiva's Shivalinga, which is a very small area, just right to have a space for any single devotee to sit and offer prayers and gratitude. As all other Lord Shiva's temples and Lingas, this particular temple also has a
The continuous Abhishek Patra on the top of this, offering the Abhushek. Once you have offered your gratitude you can take steps from otherwise and then walk outside ,which leads to a Mandapa.
Which is a masterpiece of art! Having almost 12 pillars , all having very neatly and beautifully carved statues , flowers and may be some sign arts (I can't say about the meanings of them , may be a student of architecture or a historian is apt to describe about the depth and meaning )
The ceiling, the walls, the pillars ,if you see closely, you will find every inch is decorated with neat and measured textures and art forms, like Gandharvas, Ganikas, Dancers with poses , snakes and Cobras,flowers etc. If seen keenly you can see the natural colours as well to the art form.
It creates peaceful yet goofy feel inside, great for meditation!
The outside of the temples are also equally beautiful. Yes here also you can witness the brutality with all the status , almost all of them
disfigured and mutilated , as at all other Hindu Temples, especially by the Enemies.
Remarkable thing is government here is preserving and taking care of this site as the heritage site keeping it clean , and accessible to people.
The place is having ample parking .

And the most things that you must have to carry water bottle with you there you'll not get any shop once you start your trekking.,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNRb9LLFSUCDIQ9LHZMpDThuunH-V2DHD5iSjAv=w1920-h1080-k-no,plastic,,,,,,0,0,Karnala Bird Sanctuary - Panvel - Holidify,,0,34,5,16,76,,day trip,,,50,0,,Wednesday,,,,0,3.5,Thursday,,,14,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM5ZSvp7STBgUGNOYPI5v4YKd65sz1ltl7g4lck=w150-h150-k-no-p,18,,12,,Monday,,9,,,,58,,,4.3,,,150,9,8,,,0,,18,93,,,"NH 66, Karnala, Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra 410206, India",,65337,70,56,False,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMHYQbeWohrwzEinuM8wfnp9vhTAXdq2gOCE8Fs=w1920-h1080-k-no,,12,,,Karnala Fort,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMK0fbAgiqSaS581Lf87QrhBFy2FesVumIA_tTy=w1920-h1080-k-no,0,0,2023-03-17T18:59:11.444Z,,,कर्नाळा पक्षी अभयारण्य,11,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Karnala+Bird+Sanctuary/@18.8910379,73.1219185,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x3be7e74786430a17:0xff3d39e03140a0d8!8m2!3d18.8910379!4d73.1219185!16zL20vMDJ5anQz?hl=en",21,17,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMjW4KkaREpQHP6HyqTsTa3SiKaIK0njkO92oWo=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,23,,,42,,,21,ChIJFwpDhkfn5zsR2KBAMeA5Pf8,,3 months ago,Asha Naik,6,2022-12-31T04:29:37.046Z,5,,People also search for,,,20,19,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP2zW2qnMkTfpooPnAkiE3HMqb8F6pLq-lLxYNM=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,,,0,7,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108236072772686416043?hl=en-US,7,,,Flamingo Sanctuary,,,,,,,0,,0,,True,23,,19,,False,201,Tourist attraction,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN5KoHdXSXS11wG6d8_AyNXxIRtlIgTEVzYDWVo=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,7 AM to 3 PM,6,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOADeI0dNOgYIkU5ltAAScsp_jEuRHaLdpR7kax=w1920-h1080-k-no,,True,"We went from Mumbai for a day's outing at it is nearby. The roads are good. Our intention was mainly to see birds and do some trek if time permits. However the birds in the cage are few, so it took 10 minutes, which is bit disappointing. Then we started to trek for the Fort which they say is 90 minutes and beginner friendly. We started at 12.45 noon. It took us 2 hours for the climb. It is tough for non trekkers like us. But it was very exciting and tiring. We climbed the entire 3 km, but the entry to fort is closed. So one can just see the fort gate from outside and return. It was hot the entire trail, so dress accordingly.
The down trail again took us 90 minutes, but was much better than the climb. Get good shoes and tough clothing.

There is a basic canteen at the entrance of the sanctuary. They serve snacks and select snacks, and serves the purpose. Beware of monkeys. On the trek itself, there is no food outlet, but you can bring food and water from home and have it. Drinking water is a must. Just maintain cleanliness, as they count the food item packets when you buy tickets and recount them when you exit the sanctuary. Per person ticket is 60 inr, and 4 wheeler parking is 195 (ridiculous). The closing time is 5 pm, while it says 3 pm on Google. If you are prepared to trek and are in decent health. I wont recommend the Fort trek to someone who is 45 or 50 an above unless they are fit and seasoned trekkers. But there are other 30 min trails as well. I didn't explore them this time.

Overall it a good day outing.",,13,17,Parks,,,,12,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMjayTDlzymDWRiIw7xoI7QeNc1TPnQPF7h3Ibk=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,8,,0,,2 months ago,,Maharashtra,8,

There is an exclusive chocolate factory as well. The khakhra unit is also there which smells amazing. Strawberry cream is a must have in their restaurant. It is very pretty and beautiful. During the lunch hours there is a lot of rush in the restaurant.
The parking space is hard to find and the service also becomes very slow due to that. I am not giving this place 5 stars because it is a bit expensive. Even though it is a factory outlet the prices that the charge is high.

I expect some kind of discounts when I go to factory outlets.But nevertheless the place is really nice and well maintained.

This 140-year-old laundry system, located in the heart of Mumbai, is a hub of activity and a testament to the hard work and dedication of Mumbai's washermen, or dhobis.

The dhobis, who come from different parts of India, wash thousands of clothes a day, using traditional methods that have been passed down through generations. The clothes are soaked, scrubbed, beaten, and hung to dry in the sun, and the end result is fresh, clean clothes that smell amazing.

Visiting Dhobi Ghat is a fascinating experience, as it provides a glimpse into the daily lives of the dhobis and their tireless work. The sight of clothes being washed and hung to dry on lines stretched across the ghat is a sight to behold. The ghat is a bustling hive of activity, with the dhobis moving around with their bundles of clothes, and there's a constant buzz of activity.

The ghat is also a great place to take pictures, and the vibrant colors of the clothes against the backdrop of the ghat make for stunning photos. There are also plenty of street vendors selling refreshments, snacks, and souvenirs, making it a perfect spot for a quick snack break.

It's definitely worth a visit for anyone interested in seeing a slice of everyday life in Mumbai.",6,13,58,Other,73,,,12,,0,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOMULne8Hk_zA2ZXfN0UqpyK2fo6WUL10twO5J9=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,8,0,69,,3 weeks ago,,Maharashtra,8,56

You get a beautiful view of the rajmachi fort from here. The water was however a bit less today due to no rains in the recent week, but enough to play and enjoy. The trek is a steep decent for the first 1 hour and almost flat at the end. It was quite slippery. The last 5 kms of roads are bad like everyone has mentioned on the reviews. The trek start point is correctly marked on the maps and there is a small sign board which shows the start point. There was a boy sitting near the entrance asking if someone wanted a guide.

We went from the Bhaja caves side, which was about a 1-1.5 hour trek one way. The route is well marked with chalk arrows and very beautiful. The terrain is steep and slippery - but not too bad if you're experienced. Nice to have a fort trek that isn't just all steps.

At the top, the fort is a 350 acre plateau with well preserved walls and some old stone structures. Overall, would highly recommend. There are other ways to approach too, but unfortunately don't know too much about them.

The fort is just as ancient as it is. And the place is wide open and has great views. You can spend an amazing time over here. Can't be explored within a day, as you'll come here and walk along and sit in a spot for the peace of the destination.
For this you must visit as early as possible in the morning because it's really crowded mostly on weekends. So do reach here by 6 am if possible and have a glance at the wonderful sunrise.
Thus you can walk over the place, take pictures and keep it on as you wish.
The best part is that it is really open and the everlasting view of it is just mesmerizing.
Do go out with your friends and families. Do eat bhaje there and the rest of the items as per your needs.
Must visit.
Can be visited multiple times a year.
Good luck!",,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNYW8g5O0q_ZEG0MoqG4saxkUbAMMvbZE-8G-aD=w1920-h1080-k-no,buttermilk,,,13,,,0,0,"Sinhagad Fort Pune Timings, Entry Fee, Ticket Cost Price",,26,,2,14,104,Fortress,torna fort,,,90,16,,Wednesday,,,,0,4.8,Thursday,0,,12,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOPKjYFMBI0gFKgUgl3UBqn9rgAtlt7DShbBQDX=w150-h150-k-no-p,16,10,10,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOv0c0K10ir_UBFoSoprSMqomkOuOBTRYtwAxl2=w150-h150-k-no-p,Monday,,7,9,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNP0Fptdf7SHKWnckje9KMwXyAVg2Uc_l9uaO-h=w150-h150-k-no-p,,62,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMq2TOuZ8SplN_KTCSZEdFMcNVD6SqN9zOJ4U2U=w150-h150-k-no-p,4.6,,,722,3,6,14,,9,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMSA_4FSD-A4fciqWp0JUsEGfctbL0S1Xcm7oni=w150-h150-k-no-p,16,93,0,,"Sinhagad Ghat Rd, Thoptewadi, Maharashtra 411025, India",,248182,48,26,False,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOjmgwjRXlEXFnliIWuGEkDF1hQU9sbuNM3yJC9=w1920-h1080-k-no,8,8,6,,"कोंढाणा गड, fort Kondhana",,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOp_z63en3i5LeVKFSmZUx18Y7b_AHEWovNF0nK=w150-h150-k-no-p,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOJ3AC5iOs7ADJKsF2SjeDzjHhxB3vwbB8JEXKE=w1920-h1080-k-no,16,0,2023-03-17T19:10:38.938Z,16,,,9,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sinhagad+Fort/@18.366277,73.7558777,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x3bc293e6861118d9:0xcbb4d589c7d4e90b!8m2!3d18.366277!4d73.7558777!16zL20vMDVra3lk?hl=en",19,15,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipORxeaAmKwDZR1dnjaZkRZTCE0RZ2eU1O4EArUG=w150-h150-k-no-p,17,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNfSUrtKyp5BpmAKV6aS1SAAO0-lpu1CcZ7SN8N=w1920-h1080-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMrqwveJz5-wI563-Jj3SlYgRo2aMTSKTzMFatO=w150-h150-k-no-p,,13,21,,,89,0,2,19,ChIJ2RgRhuaTwjsRC-nUx4nVtMs,,3 months ago,vipul gagare,14,2022-12-29T13:01:36.479Z,5,0,People also search for,18,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPQqxSBZlyAeS5QPxcN-CNKJ-OPG4Jp-MC2cfE1=w150-h150-k-no-p,16,17,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNGNtrTaiimCDXz7w3Z8vnxjVy-tN7qYEgE4VsZ=w1920-h1080-k-no,,11,7,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO6D8eEyVZ9lkcjytJQbAmr5i9eBgiyteK1LCE3=w150-h150-k-no-p,,31,5,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115317988070221046488?hl=en-US,17,,,Sunrise Point,15,12,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNYgD0480YdoEWlPXLpuvsIVxJEt9PkEK5WLNd9=w150-h150-k-no-p,5,0,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNolPmnxzN8AOvnFLyLzaD8bEg8NzHQP_WDEq8b=w150-h150-k-no-p,0,14,True,21,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNPbt7PvumNKcWLvt2nlzLq0nD4lSN8W72wA02c=w150-h150-k-no-p,False,735,Tourist attraction,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPsPByHpOoMYXYPe_hIqVp_I0LclFd1cRorlMaE=w1920-h1080-k-no,9,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMplM_Toyl_olq3L7CrAFZD8SkCPFlTbd6VvxBF=w150-h150-k-no-p,5 AM to 6 PM,4,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMSsJCmAhS7nb9PhsmJeFKh1mZI9POodpKmheZk=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,"Surreal, very calming environment.

Due to clouds it was difficult to see some things. Also you have to be careful while walking as things are not clearly visible due to clouds.
Recommend to read history before visiting the fort, so you can feel the importance of the place when you are walking there.
I don't recommend visiting on Sunday because there will be huge traffic jams as most of the people park their vehicles on the road side. Even when we visited on Saturday, when we left around 2 in the afternoon we were stuck around 1 hr.
Another suggestion is you can trek route, I did not go that route, so not sure about the difficulty.

It is a kids-friendly spot that offers a great outing experience for everyone. The monument has a rich historical significance and is a well-known tourist place.

Apart from admiring the grand architecture of the Gateway of India, one should not miss the ferry ride that takes off from here. It is an excellent experience, especially if you are on a date. Booking a ferry ride around sunset is highly recommended as the golden sky and its reflection in the sea water is a mesmerizing sight. The cool breeze touching your cheeks and seagulls flying next to you make it a peaceful and mind-calming experience.

Overall, the Gateway of India is a must-visit place for anyone traveling to Mumbai. Whether you're a history buff, architecture enthusiast, or just looking for a family outing, this iconic monument has something for everyone.",,,,Food & Drink,,,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNg_X_GuoyWes3nt2Q7I0N14X6HfWECQe1xilIs=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_lDBVzPwtwC-ThkAmsOCP4tOC9jwLVTQGHs02=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,a month ago,,Maharashtra,,

There’s actually a lot of difference between watching a tiger in the zoo and then watching in the jungle, passing by your side. So thrilling it was. So our safari timing was from 2pm to 6pm. I suggest to carry some snacks with you as there’s nothing to eat near the navegaon gate of safari.
Camera is allowed with some charges for the safari but mobiles aren’t allowed. They collect your phone before starting the safari. Take proper precautions and wear full clothes as lot of dust is there.

We spotted many birds and animals like sambar deer, peacock, nilgay, monkey, deer and most importantly we spotted tigress maya with her cub.

During monsoons this place becomes lush green and you will get to see too much of waterfalls. During winters you may find one or two waterfalls.

There is a view point right in front of the caves. You will have climb up to see the complete view of Ajanta. If you move forward, you will see a multi level waterfall. That waterfall actually made my day. I would suggest you to visit around sunset time. I have share some pictures and videos.

The rain was settled and the water in late and river is also reduced compared to July month. It's a beautiful place with lovely views. Due to less water it was safe to get inside water and enjoy the dip. The water is clean and flowing. Less crowd and fortunately not much of commercialization!! This place is must visit if you live in Mumbai/Navi Mumbai.

Few points to consider

1. The actual dam is closed for common public. You need to drive further post the map's spot and reach a bridge. This place has access to water.

2. It's advisable to carry some snaks items, however do not litter around. Carry the waste back home and dispose off.

3. Mostly on Saturday and Sunday police don't allow tourists. It's better to start early and cross the Nhare village ASAP before police starts checking, ideally before 9-10 am

Last but not least, water levels are low but there are deep spots and patches where one can slip, hence take care and avoid stunts. Enjoy!!",,,,Other,,,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNQ_md3EIFGRFreMa1VsrzTIkCMn3FgJxKLBbmJ=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMAw2UIJrzs4WN6p1LGYmzeYslRzv7aa1wDbpz_=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,6 months ago,,Maharashtra,,
