This place holds a lot of historical importance. It's considered sacred for the people.

For general visitors you get to see the central podium from a side queue. They have the sacred body of their Saint. The internal and external architecture is quite marvelous.

It was a reference point for the vessels coming from Europe at that time. This old Portuguese fort stands on the beach south of Candolim, at the shore of the Mandovi River. It was initially tasked with defense of shipping and the nearby Bardez sub-district.

A freshwater spring within the fort provided water supply to the ships that used to stop by. This is how the fort got its name: Aguada, meaning watery in the Portuguese language. Crews of passing ships would often visit to replenish their freshwater stores. The Aguada Fort Lighthouse erected in 1864 is the oldest of its kind in Asia. Built in 1612, it was once the grandstand of 79 cannons. It has the capacity of storing 2,376,000 gallons of water, one of the biggest freshwater storage of the time in whole of Asia. This fort is divided in two segments: the upper part acted as fort and watering station, while the lower part served as a safe berth for Portuguese ships. Whereas the upper part has a moat, underground water storage chamber, gunpowder room, lighthouse, and bastions, it also has a secret escape passage to use during time of war and emergency. The lighthouse at the initial stage is used to emit light once in 7 minutes.

Fort Aguada was the most prized and crucial fort of Portuguese. The fort is so large that it envelops the entire peninsula at the southwestern tip of Bardez. Built on the mouth of Mandovi River, it was strategically located and was the chief defense of Portuguese against the Dutch.[1]

During the Salazar Administration, Fort Aguada was repurposed for use as a prison primarily, some claim, for Salazar's political opponents.[citation needed]",,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPq49WwVbef3DTThTrTJn0JWka2wx4J4I3Jg5Py=w1920-h1080-k-no,ships,,,0,,,0,0,Fort Aguada - Wikipedia,,22,,0,,16,7,storey,,,,6,27,,Wednesday,,,,0,4.3,,Thursday,0,,14,,18,12,12,,Monday,,9,,11,,,61,,,4.3,,,28,0,8,16,,0,,,18,27,,0,,"FQRF+R2F, Aguada - Siolim Rd, Sinquerium, Candolim, Aguada Fort Area, Goa, 403515, India",,4247,0,0,False,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOoPoJmQ8LHtkcLXJjbMYTOZiIiPlJvUvyupq-v=w1920-h1080-k-no,10,16,8,,Old Lighthouse Tower,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM7xQGtAnkJ_6z2zVICLjC4IRhP-H_CTA2SUeel=w1920-h1080-k-no,,11,0,2023-03-17T12:25:50.754Z,18,,लाइट हाउस अगुअदा,11,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Light+House+Aguada/@15.4920605,73.7725523,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x3bbfc10d209bb54d:0xe6f3fac922150cf9!8m2!3d15.4920605!4d73.7725523!16s%2Fg%2F11b6gcvfww?hl=en",21,17,,19,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOEXLqX4UIaBdRhzxhdWb4VxBhMQlZFspSDwGdk=w1920-h1080-k-no,,15,23,,0,5,0,21,ChIJTbWbIA3BvzsR-QwVIsn68-Y,,2 months ago,Anith Mohan,22,2023-01-27T06:22:09.903Z,5,0,People also search for,20,,77,19,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNhKqbBDftevSfoJ-_OuemiLuLfRkUnV97cuH0R=w1920-h1080-k-no,,0,9,,,0,7,,33,,,Light House,38,14,,,,7,0,,0,16,True,23,,,,False,34,,Tourist attraction,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPYhh8Ic_isnOgeg33EcWxQ5QHTq9bZ28aTe-NM=w1920-h1080-k-no,27,,10 AM to 5:30 PM,6,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNA7br0Z2oUIECM9OHzH2mbLnvKyM6C4d5feEUF=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,6,"The new Light House is situated right next to the Aguada fort.

Overall very peaceful place to visit with friends and family.,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipODcqWl4ARrAmkGtt7KJ8wI0KkMVm_xmw9troMh=w1920-h1080-k-no,mahalasa narayani temple,,,15,,,0,0,|| Welcome to Shri Mahalasa Narayani's Temple on the Internet ||,,40,,7,,16,19,quiet,,,,11,28,,Wednesday,,,,0,4.8,,Thursday,0,,14,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNFI_3yokLaTUjB515UXwejjPZFelQ5LVjBfZVI=w150-h150-k-no-p,18,12,12,,Monday,,9,,11,,,59,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP4C02Py3jubJ3rNFt6lEFMQr3qLJKU4JwZzeII=w150-h150-k-no-p,4.7,,,37,13,8,16,,13,,,18,82,,0,,"Verna Industrial Estate, Verna, Goa 403722, India",,5441,35,18,False,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPhJxzj0UQEYW6MF71mtRnp3aK6FJNlBi1UVcHw=w1920-h1080-k-no,10,40,8,,Shri Mahalasa Narayani Temple,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPYII3m0Zj3vt9dYXWaXjIZDwXYf-Qd6kJrk3zF=w1920-h1080-k-no,,23,0,2023-03-17T12:29:44.622Z,18,,श्री महालसा नारायणी देवालया,11,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Shri+Mahalasa+Narayani+Devalaya/@15.3596731,73.9448662,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x3bbfb0a45b81d9b1:0xec63a46f4a307a74!8m2!3d15.3596731!4d73.9448662!16s%2Fg%2F1vr1v2qy?hl=en",21,17,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPhxod5bGL9okMm0vWg-Vsk6ox3xJlcvxOQPmff=w150-h150-k-no-p,19,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP0D0YOSAdudFoqJuvclEVTNCsiknHTBQgbuo3y=w1920-h1080-k-no,,15,23,"Yes, it is true.

Speciality of Goa Temples is total cleanliness and pure holiness.  You will also not find any beggar outside any temple like other places in Maharashtra.

Verna is a major Industrial Area in Goa.  Shri Devi Mahalsa Temple is an old temple there.  I understood that It's the place of origin of Devi Mahalsa.  Couldn't check whether it is true or false but the temple is well renovated and maintained.  Area of this temple is also huge like other temples at Goa.  During the Portuguese era idol of Devi Mahalsa was shifted to Mhaddol Area where today we can take darshan of Devi Mahalsa. In fact today, Mhaddol Temple is like the main temple of Devi Mahalsa.   This Verna temple is also duly renovated but it still has preserved it's own old charm and surrounding.

There are other small temples in the vicinity of this temple.  Entry is restricted to those who wear shorts, bermudas, mini skirts and or other similar outfits.   This rule is almost everywhere in all the temples at Goa.   You must visit this temple if you are at Goa and if you love visiting temples.",13,35,,,22,,,12,,0,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM3nBYMTswbPgW-VAlWA6K2RTrnd0VKQGCg8Q0=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO9ZhkGP7fQOxL4ypfI3bILKVAZN5Jm7yWQwZQ=w150-h150-k-no-p,,8,0,47,,a month ago,,,Goa,8,35

It was built by muslim rular Adil shah which destroyed by Portuguese. Rebuild by chatrapati shivaji maharaj in 1675. Later it ceded to Portuguese in 1783 by kingdom of sawantwadi. On liberation of goa 1961 it becomes part of India. Present structure is repaired in 2017. Chatrapati shivaji maharaj statue is the main attraction of this fort. Bright red and white themed paint work is also good. Few repair work/improvements also in progress. Small fort not much to see nearby.

People visit this place for various reasons, but most often to admire the natural beauty and create memorable experiences.

The entry fees for the santuary is Rs 100 for adults. For the Boat Ride you need to pay extra Rs1200 ( max 12 people; so cost can be divided among all 12)

The best time to go for the boat ride is around 6:30-7AM in winters and 5:30-6AM in winters when tide is low.

You will be able to spot around 10-20 species of different bird species depending on your luck.

I had never been to a waterpark before so me and my family planned a trip to this waterpark. It was before the COVID era. So the waterpark opens at around 10-11am I'm quite not sure about the timings. After reaching there we paid the fees, got a coloured bracelet according to our age and changed our clothes. There are separate changing rooms for ladies and gents including the washrooms. There are many games that we can play here and it's family friendly and kids friendly too. We can also bring our own water toys and floaters to play in the pool. There are lifeguards all over the park to keep us safe. If you want to enjoy a full waterpark better go in the morning because as the day goes by the public will increase and you will not get floaters and other accessories to play. So it's better you go early. Anyways my favourite was the rain dance i enjoyed it very much with my niece. There will be an announcement for rain dance so whenever we listen to the announcement we used to run to the dance floor to enjoy the rain. There are other activities too but i forgot the names of the activities. After exploring the water park, we went to eat food because we were super duper hungry. There are many restaurants on the first floor inside the water park and we can enjoy the food by watching others playing in the water. My niece loved the Nescafe tea sold in one of the restaurants. I wish to come here again with my family. But after reaching home our whole body was itching because of chlorinated water and we got severe tanning and it went away after a month. So please apply sunscreen before going to this waterpark.",,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM1qO8YQlY33zAeyF2ENvCik7oRN82JxcgLj4kw=w1920-h1080-k-no,fee,,True,0,,,0,0,"Froggyland | water park | Pateapur, Nuvem - Salcete South Goa",,15,,0,,16,10,boat,,,,8,18,,Wednesday,,,,0,3.6,True,Thursday,,True,14,,18,,12,,Monday,,9,,11,,2023-02-19T03:56:02.505Z,36,,,4,,,17,0,8,16,,0,,,18,51,,0,,"Pateapur, Nuvem, Goa 403604, India",,2094,0,0,False,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNBWsipv40YgvzzG5Q3a15r0v5NAz6V4hFwck6t=w1920-h1080-k-no,10,1,,,Nagesh Water World,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM0znBbKrXbZ0ov6KtjnUPJXhqiUpkgpcizSZ_y=w1920-h1080-k-no,,10,0,2023-03-17T12:43:23.843Z,18,,फ्रोग्ग्य्लंद,11,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Froggyland+-+The+Water+World/@15.321632,73.9519311,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x3bbfb124560c287f:0x6e3a068dd5da7aa9!8m2!3d15.321632!4d73.9519311!16s%2Fg%2F11bv30jr35?hl=en",21,17,,19,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMNfMW-Z44LhvBnwbaTKuKz9_M5hTcqi7mGTHCr=w1920-h1080-k-no,,15,23,,0,5,,21,ChIJfygMViSxvzsRqXra1Y0GOm4,,a month ago,Archna yadav,17,2023-02-28T03:30:49.647Z,5,,People also search for,,,20,19,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMfXuEFc3LT8QeMxGRQ8LQJEB_1uyxriIcxs0mE=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,9,,,0,7,,25,,,Aguada Childrens Park,22,14,True,,,,0,,0,,True,23,,,,False,17,,Tourist attraction,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM8dGEHdwf3jEdCU6bTBZ4sszgTeeeFcmlLPX59=w1920-h1080-k-no,15,,10 AM to 6 PM,6,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO5vznkGuvru0xwfAiYfrd90DPwWYoEny_udG7Z=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,6,"Nice place for family, children and couples.

A small bar counter is also available with restaurant.
Coming back to museum,the entrance is at ground floor and the ticket of rs 200 per adult and 100 per child . The preferred transaction for tickets is cash payment. Once the ticket charges paid, the guide takes to show the museum displayed at first and second floor of the building.

Variety of utensils,decoratives are displayed at museum..
What I liked the most is the museum shows the journey and progress of technology by means of most old audio player and latest type of audio player.
Similarly measurement equipment, storage utensils, telephones, clocks, calculator, typewriter etc are displayed.
After view of museum the guide takes us down in the front lawn of museum. They show the variety of bonsai developed by them in last 30 years.

The Church of St. Francis of Assisi, together with a convent, was established by eight Portuguese Franciscan friars who landed in Goa in 1517.

The original church began as a small chapel, which was modified to a church in 1521 and consecrated in 1602. That building was replaced by the current structure, erected in 1661. The present-day church is a mixture of styles. Its exterior decoration is in the simple Tuscan order, but its interior—especially the main altar—is richly Baroque with Corinthian features. The three-tier exterior facade has two distinct octagonal towers, one on each side, and a small niche that houses a statue of Mary. The church’s interior includes a richly ornamental niche with a tabernacle supported by the Four Evangelists on the main altar. Above the tabernacle are two large statues, one of St. Francis of Assisi and the other of the crucified Christ. The church’s gilded interior is decorated with paintings of events in the life of St. Francis, carved woodwork, additional statues, and frescos with intricate floral designs.",13,43,,,0,,,12,,0,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMbACUHiQ_oEKpEw0Day6xd2oN1I1F4tbygNcJ7=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNLZ0OTuVAJCFXynbiK0jCini-iJ7umTOZexyFR=w150-h150-k-no-p,,8,0,0,,3 weeks ago,,,Goa,8,94

Natural way of attracting butterflies by planting required plants for them in an open place (not a enclosure ). Little difficult for aged people, but the person who looks after it in the absence of the owner (I forgot his name) is a person with vast knowledge about nature and butterflies.
And you must see their rooftop garden.

You have variety of plants, an artificial waterfall with pedicure option there.
I saw around 4-5 different butterfly. Best time to visit is early in the morning.

Good effortspaid for the conservation and hobby. Good butterflies list 23nos and some  rare tree species. Also there is some good stones collection.  However 600 rs.

But the local authorities had started repatching the roads, that we saw while coming back.
Don't know about the current situation.
I wish google maps could show the actual road conditions as well.
Advice: 
1. Avoid night driving as there are sharp turns and potholes immediate at the turns.
2. If you maintain speed of ~30 in ghat, can cross it easily
3. Ground clearance of ur vehicle should be above 170mm

It is not a highly popular tourist attraction, but still worth a visit if you are staying in Quepem or in the area.

However, it is advised to avoid visiting the dam in the evenings or at night as there is low visibility, which can make the place somewhat frightening. The dam is a great place to relax and enjoy the serene surroundings, including the tranquil sound of water and the peaceful environment. Fishing is also a popular activity at the dam.

For those who love to cycle, the dam offers a refreshing cycling experience, particularly in the evenings. While the dam is well-built, it is important to be careful of broken bottles scattered around the area.

The Quepem Dam is one of the oldest dams in Goa, with a small weir on the side, making it a suitable place for a summer picnic or a swim. During the monsoon season, the dam becomes even more stunning, but it is not recommended to go for a bath during the rainy season.

Overall, while the Quepem Dam may not be the most thrilling tourist destination, it is a nice place to spend a peaceful and relaxing time in Goa",,,,,,,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN6xMGzqu78RVa4IZMz0HQeHDk9Gw5KmwEeJN3o=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,,,,,,a month ago,,,Goa,,

The roads were crammed of people , all in a festive mood. Footpath shops sprang up. Key approach road to the church was made no-traffic zone ; making it easier for pedestrians.It is very pleasant , whether one wants to join the shoppers or the revellers or just decides to keep walking. The church was illuminated wonderfully well. We went up the stairs and watched the road from every level. View of the church from the road and view of the road from the church both were wonderful. I had a very enjoyable morning just watching the fair all around. Families had come out in droves to buy roadside knick knacks and to take part in the festivities. Decided to come back and see the church in daylight again.It can be enjoyed by anyone from any religion.

Then had to wait another 30mins to collect the life jackets which we didn’t even have to use as we didn’t go into the water at the falls. They allow only 40 vehicles into the forest, so we had to wait some cars returned. I hope they fix this whole process and make it easy for tourists otherwise people will lose interest in visiting the place. The road was very bumpy and wasn’t too easy to access, had to cross few streams. I hope they lay decent roads so more it’ll make it easily accessible.

Best experience for trekking through rivers during monsoon season.
Beautiful place to swim and bath.
If you are not interested in trekking for 11 kms you can travel to water falls by government jeeps only from kulem. You have to park your private vehicles in kulem and go through only government jeeps for ₹500 per person(maximum 7 members in a jeep). and they also charge extra ₹100 per person while starting your journey to falls.
After reaching to dudhsagar water falls after 1hr journey in jeep. You have to walk 1-2 kms definitely.
They way is full of rocks and boulders ,you have to walk very carefully and slowly. There is no flat land at all it is full of rocks, one step wrong you may affect with leg fracture or dislocation of bone orany other leg issues.
After reaching to water you can swim upto 1hr because the jeeps only wait for 1hr30mins from dropping time after that they charge extra money.
Change your dresses before reaching water falls because there is no proper dress changing rooms here only 2 or 3 available. And some restrooms.
Best experience with friends here ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",,,,,,,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNz8KgyxcI4XmMTkOLMAxxDWWUQF7sFSC-vURUT=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM0zPMMHy_Y3ibC0QxZsrg9QxfhVQ4qin-ep_9W=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,,a month ago,,,Goa,,

There is a kind of scam run by locals there. They don't allow to park anywhere (and there is a lot of empty space all around) except to one designated area which they intentionally made accident prone. To leave ""parking lot"", you have to cross very narrow bridge (ok for smaller cars and scooters). Something as big as a 4 wheel will put you in big trouble and money extortion situation.
When we decided to get some tea from small vendor (who was apparently the leader of the extortion gang) his comrads/villagers made some issue and blamed us. Since this place is in deep jungle, there is absolutely no way to communicate with outer world - no mobile signal for any operator , no police station , no authorities AT ALL. We were left in mercy of local tribe and situation was getting worse with every minute. Our car  and ourselves (6 adults, including a foreigner) were blocked and threatened! They demanded 12000 rs for some kind of scratch to another car which was few metres away ... After very hot arguments we had to give up.
The thing is that you are there on your own , absolutely helpless in case the people decide they need some extra money ...
It's better to go to some government run or organised places like Netrawali for example. Or be prepared by all means for unexpected",,,,,,,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPjaVAgecFobcAVY8G8xnEcOZTtZlYI0NljERU-=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,,,,,,6 months ago,,,Goa,,

I was pleased to hear that it's a private museum who had been collecting antiques since his childhood times at the age of 10. Through his passion for the antiques, we came to know more about the old Portugal culture in Goa.. i am also thank ful to the guide who took great interest in explaining the whole units..
There is also a cafeteria where you can take refreshments.
Do not consider this as a fun place. This is a treasure place where we find ourselves long years back..it's our history.

Best time to visit in the morning when it's too hot to go to the beach. My 7 yr old son loved it. Tickets are cheap. Place clean and well maintained, staff helpful and co-operative.
There's a 3d show, planetarium, interactive science show,hall of mirrors, ocean exhibit and general science exhibit. You can stay there as long as you'd like.
There's also well maintained play area in the garden on the compound.
Great place to engage kids for hours.

We did not go to the fort here since the view is what everyone comes for over here. There's ample parking space. This is located farther down in South Goa so reaching here would take time if you are staying in the North or even other places in the South. There is a restaurant here called the Cape Goa and a small shop where you can grab tea or beer. You can also sit and admire the view from the cliff.

To experience this spectacle, you need to take a trek route which is about 10 kms (onward and return put together).

When you park your vehicles, you can visit Mahadev temple which was built centuries ago. Though it's a small temple, it is very well maintained and gives a very pleasant and divine feeling. You have a water stream passing right next to the temple where you can relax and enjoy the nature.

Before you begin your trek, if you want to fill your tummy with some local made snacks, you have couple of stalls right next to the entrance.

During the trek, you come across many beautiful water streams all through the journey as you pass through the dense Western ghats. Need to be cautious as you pass through these streams as there's a high possibility that you come across leaches and snakes during the course of your journey.

The first glimpse of the fall itself is so magnificent. If you would like to get a bit closer to the waterfall and get drenched yourself just by sitting right next to the mainstream, you need to have a bit of energy and power as you need to climb some steep rocks to make it.

It is worth taking this as the feeling is so surreal.

You can rent out life jackets and have fun inside the water as well.
you need to hire a jeep to reach there, for which you have to stay in queue. They allocate jeeps in batches. I would recommend reaching there early so that you don't have to struggle for jeep. Also after 9-10 there will be a lot of rush on the waterfall. There is an option of reaching here by trekking as well. If possible take that. Because jeep driver will give you some limited time to stay at the fall, otherwise they will leave or charge you extra.

The fort, which is situated on a hilltop overlooking the Arabian Sea, provides sweeping ocean views and a fascinating look at Goa's colonial history.

One of the things that immediately stands out about Aguada Fort is its size. The fort is quite large and features a variety of structures, including a lighthouse that was erected in 1864. Although the fort is in a state of disrepair, it is still an impressive structure that is worth exploring.

However, despite its size and historical significance, there is not much to see at Aguada Fort. Most of the structures are in ruins, and there are few exhibits or artifacts to explain the history of the fort. The abandoned lighthouse is also off-limits to visitors, which is disappointing.

Visitors must pay an entry fee of 25 rupees for Indians and 100 rupees for foreigners to access the fort. While the fee is not particularly high, some visitors may feel that it is not worth the cost given the lack of things to see.

One of the highlights of Aguada Fort is the stunning view of the Arabian Sea from the hilltop. You can see the water from the fort, and the view is particularly breathtaking at sunset. This makes the fort a popular spot for photographers and tourists looking to take in the natural beauty of the region.

Overall, Aguada Fort is an interesting historical site that provides a glimpse into Goa's colonial past. While the lack of exhibits and the state of disrepair may be disappointing for some visitors, the stunning views of the ocean and the natural beauty of the region make it worth a visit for those interested in history and architecture.",,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN4ZxSV4PZCTU41eUEMLg3-lQS75-G4RlzgnbKR=w1920-h1080-k-no,dolphin,,,0,,,0,0,Fort Aguada Goa | Fort History & Visiting Time | Goa Tourism,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNs1MUQW8eCwsfRUOjcnIVRw6I1MSRLBOnapzd0=w150-h150-k-no-p,48,,0,,16,88,district,,,,52,45,,Wednesday,,,,0,4.2,,Thursday,0,,14,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMReUExlTc-9ag80zKVGbXlFGfRfoUUjdj19lXR=w150-h150-k-no-p,18,12,12,,Monday,,9,,11,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP4pMnyEfsQWNaxKnD0PXcSFzpxJsvuTgkgvnZL=w150-h150-k-no-p,,100,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP7w5VFVkjOCuk-XHJRcK0HrP8Qb4kgjJ-E9ZpI=w150-h150-k-no-p,4.2,,,113,7,8,16,,0,,,18,74,,0,,"Fort Aguada Rd, Aguada Fort Area, Candolim, Goa 403515, India",,205459,13,0,False,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPHUt6X6wsiKJVo7DU_apGqd4UQ17a47gZw5sw-=w1920-h1080-k-no,10,32,8,,Lower Aguada Fort,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMCx3C6g7LdtfcqYsJP8VOIe09_83CNJhUeKnkL=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOWMcfHvoDyeqf8A1JyrV4ead-flwkH6R5_W-PA=w1920-h1080-k-no,,39,0,2023-03-17T13:07:09.078Z,18,,अगौडा फोर्ट,11,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Aguada+Fort/@15.4922519,73.7737462,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x3bbfc175c68cbd6b:0xa3837630b3697b1c!8m2!3d15.4922519!4d73.7737462!16zL20vMDk0MDNx?hl=en",21,17,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMLjw663ptaSppPX4X4MXB9U6xyDkIowlKDE1QP=w150-h150-k-no-p,19,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPjpF_dVMC3brk0noU5FfTbpMmCx1eu9IQvQvAO=w1920-h1080-k-no,,15,23,,0,27,0,21,ChIJa72MxnXBvzsRHHtpszB2g6M,,3 weeks ago,NITHIN KUMAR CHINTHAKINDI,53,2023-03-12T08:39:53.659Z,3,0,People also search for,20,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOyStp3gf3joYy-xoSq-nsGoJP4y8D5u90GHTmq=w150-h150-k-no-p,86,19,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNh-Rf7u_vmVUG4w2auNmwfZcXHbbhwOpKS45qc=w1920-h1080-k-no,,0,9,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMeUC-vFqEyqHwq8Is5rypcTf-oU08anBFyc2l7=w150-h150-k-no-p,,0,7,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102493627726652061317?hl=en-US,71,,,Reis Magos Fort,44,14,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPnQAopimynHiD-VA_JUphRQe32T2GZqMlZ3Rle=w150-h150-k-no-p,7,0,,0,16,True,23,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPPU0StCU4Vjl57rXRmncz8BzffxEohXQiAZstb=w150-h150-k-no-p,False,145,,Tourist attraction,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNpXwvua_c-_QyknheK2nrCKao_tSoUieYsvu2u=w1920-h1080-k-no,68,,9 AM to 6 PM,6,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNCUR2b-7TDP_8kJdg-yEiD4fsKpEFaaigv1Rk0=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,6,"Aguada Fort and Jail are historic landmarks located in Goa, India. Aguada Fort, built in the 17th century, is a beautiful piece of architecture that boasts stunning views of the Arabian Sea. It is a perfect place to visit for anyone interested in history or architecture.

The fort is well-maintained and provides an impressive backdrop for photo opportunities. The lighthouse and the ramparts offer breathtaking views of the sea, which makes it an ideal place for a sunset walk or a picnic. The fort also has a small museum that showcases the history of the area, which is informative and interesting.

The nearby Aguada Jail is another fascinating historical site. The jail is now a museum, and it offers a glimpse into the harsh realities of colonial times. The prison cells are a sobering reminder of the inhumane treatment of prisoners in the past, and the exhibits provide a comprehensive overview of the prison's history.

Overall, Aguada Fort and Jail are two must-visit historical sites in Goa. The fort's beautiful architecture and stunning views are a treat for visitors, and the museum inside the jail offers a glimpse into the area's dark past. I highly recommend visiting these sites for anyone interested in history, architecture, or simply looking for a unique and memorable experience in Goa.",13,41,Recreations,,37,,,12,,0,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM96CJQAMkGdZ3dHPY5Ckp8z8ojdZFinvQ87gHm=w1920-h1080-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNY7d_JriblPkGO1D4FF-7fBVEv7OBFSSenUZGa=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,8,0,0,,5 days ago,,,Goa,8,59
