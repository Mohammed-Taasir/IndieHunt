Beautiful place to get touch of nature in this city lifestyle .
Try to avoid going on weekends in rainy season . cause these place is too much crowded at that time.
If you want less crowd visit early like 6 or 7 in the morning.
I am posting images with this review so you can see how big and massive this waterfall is.

Stay safe ...","Give security for public from the local drinkers. Many times they harmed to people. And another thing is there are not first aid centre. So please be carefully.

At present one lioness in the lion Safari. Few years ago I visited lion Safari, there were total four lion and lioness.
I had seen lioness from very nearly.(6 to 7 feets away) It was amazing moment.
I appreciate best efforts and arrangement of Forest Department for taking care for visitors safety.
There is a small children playing area near main entry gate of lion Safari, kids can take benefits of these facilities during waiting period.
One Big tree is also one of attraction at lion safari.
Entry Ticket fees for one adult person is only 25 Rupees. it's very reasonable.
Waiting Period for visit is 20 minutes to 1 hour. It's depend upon total numbers of visitor and timing of visit.
Personally I Suggest, try to arrange visit at 10 am.Everyday lion Safari opens for visit at 10 am.
Every Monday it's remain close for visit.",,3,,2023-03-15T18:29:46.804Z,,,,,2023-03-13T17:58:55.022Z,People also search for,,lion safari vasona,,,,,,tickets,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Satmaliya Deer Park,,,275,,4,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,,221,,,IN,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyOVlhSGd3RRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0xab948dd261866683!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgID29YaHgwE%7CCgsI38i9oAYQwJHuCg%7C?hl=en-US,,,False,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNoD_GZYillAtuooZ6tdbPez170OFQzg9xBDwEC=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,,,,61,,,,,,,,,,,Tourist attraction,,2256,People also search for,,,Silvasa Vasona Lion Safari,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMI6lYcl62w93TtU00ofNbutXXhVl4lywfcVne9=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Lions+Safari+Vasona/@20.1990475,73.0428848,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x3be73519501aeeb7:0xab948dd261866683!8m2!3d20.1990475!4d73.0428848!16s%2Fg%2F11n0d6j81c?hl=en",No it's closed,People also search for,,,True,,,,,,,,,,3.6,,,,,,,,Close till 15 November,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,sandeep bhamare,,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115058126333157620934?hl=en-US,,,,,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoaUpuTmNBEAE,,,,,,,,,,,,10,,,,,,,,,,,21,28,"https://www.google.com/maps/search/dadra+and+nagar+haveli+places+to+visit/@20.2210839,72.991576,12z/data=!3m1!4b1?hl=en",a month ago,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108190074401535401903,,,,"52XV+J56, Unnamed Road, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu 396230, India",https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMrN8NmwREGhaUBZF3CBLMzoOdMzWvRWjuke__V=w1920-h1080-k-no,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPlvItVeWCrErdE-Z4sgjXzr9ZCD5iNl62Fjzbe=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPydB2mor2MHfEe6ZomAw9c2cBAp5DkVPuGZ9IX=w1920-h1080-k-no,,People also search for,13,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Local Guide,,,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,True,,,,,

Entry is rs 25 for 5 years plus. Below 5 years and senior citizen entry is free. The garden is having approx. area of 7 hectares. Kids play stuff and open gym is good. Lake is containing water species like tortoise, ducks, fishes and more. Boating facility is available for family and group at 150rs  & 250rs respectively. The main advantage is that you can carry your own food so that it can be treated as a picnic spot. But whether must be supportive as in hot conditions it is difficult to visit the entire garden. In night perhaps the water fountains must be active. Share your experience.","Garden is open or not today?
