The dargah is believed to be one of the most sacred shrines in the region, attracting thousands of devotees from different parts of India and abroad.

The dargah is situated atop a small hill, which is accessible by a steep climb of around 400 steps. The climb can be challenging, especially for those with physical disabilities, but the views from the top are breathtaking, making it a rewarding experience. The shrine is surrounded by lush greenery, which adds to its serene and tranquil atmosphere.

The architecture of the dargah is a blend of Mughal and local Assamese styles, which is unique and distinctive. The complex includes several buildings, including a mosque, a madrasa, and a library, all of which are well-maintained and exquisitely designed. The main shrine houses the tomb of the revered saint, Syed Shamsul Arefin, who is believed to have traveled to Mecca on foot, hence the name Poa Mecca.

The dargah is open to people of all faiths, and visitors are expected to respect the religious sentiments of the devotees. The shrine is known for its peaceful and harmonious environment, which is a testament to the message of brotherhood and unity that the saint preached during his lifetime.

Visitors to the dargah are advised to dress modestly and remove their shoes before entering the shrine. There are also several shops and stalls selling devotional items, souvenirs, and refreshments, making it a lively and bustling place.

Overall, Poa Mecca Dargah Sharif is a must-visit destination for anyone interested in exploring the rich cultural and religious heritage of Assam. The site is not only a symbol of spiritual significance but also an architectural marvel, offering a glimpse into the unique blend of cultures that have influenced the region over the centuries.",,3,2023-03-15T05:27:42.983Z,20,15,8,19,2023-03-11T07:31:29.457Z,People also search for,Hazarat Shah Jamal Baba Darghah Sharif,,41,10,1,,,mosque,7,,10,5,20,,,,,,3,,,19,23,22,poa mecca sunset point,38,,0,22,5,26,1,,21,5,No.1 Bhelkar,15,6,18,22,7,31,9,25,,20,55,36,21,15,16,15,8,21,17,3,22,,17,20,18,https://en.wikipedia.org › wiki › Hajo,4,13,2869,16,23,IN,14,,32,3,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoMGJiX3ZRRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0xdc5ce5eff1085460!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDh0bb_vQE%7CCgwI0dywoAYQuLas2gE%7C?hl=en-US,,,False,9,10,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMRweZOb4muHaXdkK16NA35NQvtYFMO7T-yr-MS=w1920-h1080-k-no,1,37,,7,5,,111,"Hajo is an ancient pilgrimage centre for three religions: Hinduism, Buddhism, ...

It is believed that a body part (Thigh) of Goddess Sati consort of Lord Shiva dropped here at hilltop. Since then, it has been regarded as one of the Shakti Peethas of Assam. Devotess throng to this place in huge numbers in order to make their wish fullfiled.

There are two temples located in this premise. One is located below at plain, and the other is located at the top of hill. Both the temples are equally important. In order to reach the hilltop temple one need to climb up the hill by stairs. There are around 800 steps to be covered to reach the hilltop temple. If you are physically weak and undergoing some major disease, better to consider your climb.

There are a lot of monkeys at the hill. Monkeys would step beside you and snatch  everything whatever you carry in your hands. So I suggest you to go in group and hold a stick to frighten the monkeys. However monkeys dont attack humans. They are only after your packets of offerings.

The Ugratara temple of Guwahati, Assam is said to be a ""Shakti Pitha"", a temple built over body parts of Goddess Sati as per Hindu mythology. It is believed that here a portion of the navel of the Goddess fell, and petrified into a stone block which is kept inside a small 'Kund' (water body) in the sanctum of the temple.
The antrum of the temple houses two metallic (made of Ashta Dhatu, an alloy of eight metals) idols of Goddess Kali, one new and the other old.
It is said that once the idol (at that time only one idol was there) was stolen and all efforts to get it back failed. After six months a new idol was made to be installed in the temple. But surprisingly, the stolen idol was recovered by police and brought back to the temple before the new one was installed.
So, both the idols were installed for worshipping.

The temple has 3 parts - a wide hall or Mandapa in front, an antrum in the middle with two idols of the Goddess and a sanctum behind with the water filled octagonal ""Kund"" where the rock regarded as the petrified navel of Goddess Sati is kept.
It is said that this ""Kund"" is connected to the river Brahmaputra, and it's water level falls and rises along with the water level of Brahmaputra.

On top of the sanctum there is an elongated dome shaped tower or Shikhar. As a whole the temple is built as per Nilachala style.

Behind the temple there are two big ponds collectively called ""Jor Pukhuri"" (Twin Ponds).

One interesting thing in this temple of Goddess Ugratara is a large number of pigeons which walk and fly here and there fearlessly. These pigeons are dedicated to the Goddess, and are marked with a vermilion spot on their forehead.

The Shiva temple

Every Shakti temple is accompanied by a temple of Lord Shiva, known usually as the Bhairava of the Goddess.

At Ugratara temple complex, there is a white coloured temple built in the Nilachala style with a tall elongated dome shaped tower or Shikhara.

The antrum of the temple houses a small Narayana idol and a beautiful marble statue of Goddess Saraswati, the goddess of Learning and Knowledge.

Laokhowa Wildlife Sanctuary is protected area located in the state of Assam in India. This wildlife sanctuary covers 70.13 km², on the south bank of the Brahmaputra River in Nagaon district, It is situated 40 km downstream of the Kaziranga National Park and 30 km northwest of the Orang National Park on the other side of the river BrahmaputraIt is a part of the Laokhowa-Burachapori eco-system. The sanctuary is an ideal habitat for Indian rhinoceros and Asiatic water buffaloes. Other animals found here are the royal Bengal tiger, Indian leopard, Indian boar, civet, leopard cat, hog deer, etc. Over 200 species of birds have been recorded in the sanctuary, including migratory birds.

Laokhowa had more than 70 Indian rhinos in early 1980s which were all killed by poachers. In 2016, two rhinos, a mother and her daughter, were reintroduced to the sanctuary from Kaziranga National Park as part of the Indian Rhino Vision 2020 (IRV 2020) program, but both animals died within months due to natural causes.

It is open for tourists from the beginning of November to the end of April. এতিয়া এইখন অলপ ঠাণ্ডা বাবে আৰু ভাল লগা হল।",,Is it safe to visit? ,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPTbESGUoYxI4zaCJAwnqXK52ldNu4YyXMKBj-C=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111550868836427561864?hl=en-US,beautiful,77,85,87,,80,,,,0,,"https://www.google.com/maps/search/assam+places+to+visit/@26.8081595,92.5406597,8z/data=!4m2!2m1!6e1?hl=en",,True,5,83,,,,8,,I have worked there.

There are 1 or 2 more waterparks but don't go there, they are not so big. In accoland you can enjoy amusement park and water rides. The right time and day to visit this place is weekend. Don't even think of going there on weekdays if you are just 4-5 people. As some rides need a minimum of 6 people to operate them like flying chairs. Even if you are going on weekdays then reach there by 1 or 2 as they close most of the water rides by 5 and rides by 6. The accoland is situated on a very secluded place and Guwahati traffic is really irritating, don't plan to see other places if you are visiting this. Now water rides, they were all amazing, terrific, horrifying and fun to do. Most water rides need 2 people to sit on the tube. Most of the rides can be done unlimited times but not bumping cars, 3d show. Lastly, take a locker or where will you put your phones and clothes. Locker and clothes amount is fully refundable they just cut some 20 or 40 that's it. Also some workers there were really good, they let me do the water rides although we were only 2 people.",,4,2023-03-15T05:44:01.271Z,84,17,,21,2022-11-21T16:56:05.207Z,People also search for,University Water Park - A,,,14,,,+91 99541 71224,water rides,,,0,7,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOLaOG7YffnLRXqnpGQOd661finOSm-0oeTIsqD=w150-h150-k-no-p,,,,,21,,,DHURBA'S DREAMLAND,0,,13,,4,14,1,,0,0,Pat Gaon,17,8,20,,0,29,11,44,,0,79,61,23,17,18,43,0,23,24,,0,,19,22,20,https://www.youtube.com › watch,5,0,18442,,40,IN,16,,100,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQtcEl5Q2ZREAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x372225389e5101be!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgID-pIyCfQ%7CCgsIpdvumwYQuISBYw%7C?hl=en-US,True,,False,14,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO1jc9DvvAqKeMFiXtkxsiNISQcq-2S6lUXis0-=w1920-h1080-k-no,,50,,9,0,,8,"Children - Rs. 650/-.

It is a 3 story building.

The sanctuary is named after the Hoolock Gibbon, one of the most important inhabitants of the sanctuary. The Hoolock Gibbon is an endangered species of primate that can only be found in this part of the world. Visitors to the sanctuary can witness these fascinating creatures in their natural habitat, swinging from tree to tree and playing with their young.

In addition to the Hoolock Gibbon, the sanctuary is also home to other endangered species such as the Asian elephant, , the Indian python,  Visitors can take a guided tour of the sanctuary to spot these animals and learn about their habits and habitats.

The sanctuary is also a paradise for bird lovers, with over 200 species of birds being found here. Some of the more notable species include the white-winged wood duck, the black stork, and the great pied hornbill. The sanctuary offers bird watching tours, which are a must for any serious bird enthusiast.

The sanctuary is well-maintained and the staff is knowledgeable and friendly. Visitors can stay in the sanctuary's eco-cottage, which is designed to be environmentally friendly and offers a unique and comfortable accommodation option

A good place to see gibbons, and a pretty organized and serious wildlife sanctuary. Entry only by guided walk. Price is 600 per group for guide and ""gunman"" (to protect from wild elephants and leopards - not usually seen), plus per person entry fee of 500 (foreign) or 50 (Indian). The guides will take you into the forest for a couple hours, and can usually find some gibbons for you if you come in the morning (early, around 7am, is said to be best). Langur monkeys, several macaque species, and giant squirrels are also possible, but unpredictable.

If possible, bring binoculars - the gibbons never come down from the tall trees. In wet weather, you also might want something to cover the top of your shoes to protect from leeches. Probably not an issue on the main trails, but guides will sometimes take you bushwhacking off trail to find the gibbons.

The park can close unpredictably, especially lately because of a rhino from Kaziranga on the loose (they're trying to find and move it). In case it's closed or you're not satisfied, you can try walking the road between the sanctuary entrance and the highway. You can sometimes find gibbons and langur monkeys there too if you look carefully. Make sure not to walk there at night though - it's prohibited due to serious danger from wild elephants.",,5,2023-03-15T05:47:22.377Z,94,15,80,19,2023-03-07T17:46:38.852Z,People also search for,"Inspection Bunglow, Gibbon Wildlife Sanctuary",,87,9,1,,,species,80,,80,5,87,,,,,,3,,,19,23,88,ONGC Avian Park,85,,348,22,5,71,317,,81,70,Jorhat,15,6,18,22,61,67,9,82,,75,61,80,21,15,16,70,74,21,11,3,92,,17,20,18,https://www.kaziranga-national-park.com › ho...,4.2,90,2499,95,66,IN,14,,87,3,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURoNXFTTWFREAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x206967dff0222cbd!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDh5qSMaQ%7CCgwI_vCdoAYQkK_UlgM%7C?hl=en-US,,,False,77,82,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPnNRDcLV6lE_ICJFTo5EuWcGKdLcUNK2UBA_Mn=w1920-h1080-k-no,1,70,,7,73,,21,"The Hoollongapar Gibbon Sanctuary at Jorhat in Assam is a special place.

It covers an area of 79.28 km2 (30.61 sq mi). It was established as a sanctuary in 1985 and declared a national park on 13 April 1999. It has a rich flora and fauna, including great Indian rhinoceros, pygmy hog, Asian elephant, wild water buffalo and Bengal tiger. It is the only stronghold of rhinoceros on the north bank of the Brahmaputra river.The park has a chequered history of habitation. Up to 1900, it was inhabited by the local tribes. On account of an epidemic disease, the tribal population abandoned the area. However, in 1919 the British declared it as Orang Game Reserve vide notice No. 2276/R dated 31 May 1915. The game reserve came under the control of the wild life wing of the State Forest Department to meet the requirements of the Project Tiger. It was established as a wild life sanctuary in 1985, vide notification No. FRS 133/85/5 dated 20 September 1985. But in 1992, the park was renamed as Rajiv Gandhi Wildlife Sanctuary but this action had to be reversed due to public pressure against the renaming. Finally, the sanctuary was declared as National Park in 1999 vide notification No. FRW/28/90/154 dated 13 April 1999.[1]",,Is there Jeep Safari and elifhant saffari counter there,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNHcH7l0BaKcjKpkkStbIGx7MZr96A4PrUT17FN=w150-h150-k-no-p,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112614309565524833326?hl=en-US,rhino,,,,,,,,,,,"https://www.google.com/maps/search/assam+places+to+visit/@26.8081595,92.5406597,8z?hl=en",,True,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOwlLvvuKKk2HIus089ATHxVpcduZQBgXlxHOlP=w150-h150-k-no-p,True,,,"A wonderful experience indeed.

Great picnic spot with a cultural twist!😍 This is an archeological site with significance to Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism! There is a large picnic area, couple of good treks, a temple and a lake with boating! Great for day outings!!!🥳🥂.
Thousands of Ancient sculptures in this Sri Surjya(Sun) temple. Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism historical & archaeological values. Very nice tourist place as well as picnic spot.
Located about 12 kms from Goalpara, this hill is a popular archeological site.
This area has many rock carvings relating to Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. The hill has many Shiva lingas of different sizes and shapes.
It also happens to be a popular picnic  spot as there is a stream at the base of the hill.
The abundance of greenery in the area makes it more attractive😊.
This hill is definitely worth visiting for those who are interested in archeology and history. Nature lovers  too find this place very pleasing.

The views, in the winter, as the fog sticks around the natural scenery. So beautiful. It's the largest reserve of rhinoceros. Saw 9-10 rhinos as they came out, and more were hiding in the forest.
But during the jeep safari, didn't see much wildlife, most of the places were just wild grasses and trees.

From the disposition of the broken stone blocks scattered here, archeological experts have opined that the original temple was a Panchayatan type of temple where five temples are arranged in such a way that the main shrine with the deity of the principal god is placed at the center of a square place, the 4 corners of which is the site of 4 similar but smaller temples with the idols of (usually) 4 different deities.
Experts also concluded that the main temple was dedicated to Lord Vishnu.

The ruins contain broken stone blocks of different sizes and many of those have stunningly beautiful bas-relief decorations of geometric and floral designs, gods, demigods, dancers and warriors.
