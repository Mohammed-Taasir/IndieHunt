They have cottages as well which one needs to book in advance through the Odisha Tourism website.
Food was very good.
Nature lovers will enjoy the screnery & peace for sure.
Best time to visit post Noon till evening as we can take good photographs.
The route mostly is good apart from one section of approx 8KM which is really bad, I think the situation might change in a few months as the road is under construction.

trip to this place. This is located at the corner of bhubaneswar city. Here you can get a view of bhubaneswar. Also you can view a temple (basically a Jain temple) on the top of the hill.

This is a heritage site and you will find a good crowd on the weekends here but the government is not giving importance to this place. No one cares about the cleaning and maintenance of this site. You'll see most of the couples kissing and hugging behind the shrubs. This is not the way to make this place worse. I'm attaching some pics and video for your reference.

At the end I will suggest you to visit this place if you are in Bhubaneswar.

But it is risky and the approach roads are not at all good. Further if you happen to be with family or small kids... Then the safest bet is to visit Urmagarh Waterfall...It provides the same enthralling and mesmerizing feeling and it is safe even for kids... Besides the approach roads are superb and you literally don't go on a rollercoaster ride as with the other waterfalls nearby...This is a great picnic spot and like every other place in Phulbani...You can literally breathe fresh air everywhere...Most importantly there is a great park adjacent to it... it's just not a makeover park but a proper park...So kids can spend hours enjoying themselves while you are busy cooking for your picnic party...❣️😍🥰👌😊🤩👍♥️

Urmagarh waterfall is named after Urma Devi who is considered as the key goddess of the local tribes and it is believed that nobody can escape from this deity by saying a lie or giving a false statement. Thus she becomes the witness for truth and faith...🙏❣️😍🥰👌😊🤩👍♥️🙏

Here is a brief overview of the different waterfalls collected from various sources:-

Pakdajhar waterfall is situated at a distance of about 3–5 km from Sudrukumpa, a small village which is situated about 19 km from the main city of Phulbani. Last but not the least, there is Urmagarh waterfall, which is close to 21 km from Phulbani.

Marine Drive is not huge. There are many shops on the beach in the evening, only a few eateries (just some snacks and coconuts) during the day. The waves of the sea are not as huge as Puri, but they are not bad, you can bathe properly. No water sports activities are arranged here. Right next to the beach there is a very old ruined building, probably a merchant's residence/trade center/warehouse. It once spread over vast areas, but now many hotels have sprung up occupying most of it, and many parts of it on the beach side have gone under either under water/sand or completely destroyed.

atop Langudi Hill (or Hills) in Jajpur district of Odisha, India. Pushpagiri was mentioned in the writings of the Chinese traveller Xuanzang (c. 602 – c. 664) and some other ancient sources. Until the 1990s, it was hypothesised to be one or all of the Lalitgiri-Ratnagiri-Udayagiri group of monastic sites, also located in Jajpur district. These sites contain ruins of many buildings, stupas of various sizes, sculptures (many now removed to museums), and other artifacts.

However, archaeological excavations conducted at Langudi Hills during 1996-2006 resulted in the discovery of another site, with inscriptions describing the local monastery as puṣpa sabhar giriya, and identified by the excavators as Pushpagiri. This has now become the general view among scholars. The site has now been made accessible for tourism.

The visit of Xuanzang indicates that Pushpagiri was an important Buddhist site in ancient India.

Very calm and nice beach.If female visitors then I suggest please return before sun sets cos of safety concerns.

Very nice place to go for a family picnic during the winter. To reach you have to take left from Konisi Hatto and then left from Dumdumi village and then through after solbindha and kirtipur village this village will come and then straight to the beach.

I must suggest to take a bath here cos the beach is very wide and open and beautiful clean water due to the less visitors. It's not so deep even after you go 50-70 metres inside the beach. So you will feel good to take bath here.

I and our families have been here for many times cos of the easy reach and less crowded not like Gopalpur which is very crowded these days.

You might encounter jackals if you're all alone after it gets dark cos they come to drink water and eat sea 🦀🦀🦀🦀.",,,,,,,,,,,A Perfect Place to Visit in Odisha - Garampeta Beach / odia ...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.4,,3,,,,,,,,,,,"6R2X+QJ6, Garampeta, Odisha 760003, India",,,363,,,False,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMH_LhuMGui0QstUEv0Wk3S9eBv0WsafTtfhOsN=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,Garampeta new park,,,,,,,2023-03-17T07:45:28.111Z,,,,,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Garampeta+Beach/@19.2019023,84.8490177,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x3a3d5de16e22c6d1:0x87bc49cf26fa4401!8m2!3d19.2019023!4d84.8490177!16s%2Fg%2F11qqj4fz3m?hl=en",,,,,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMXU373TkXELGpZ9w-tfkO_xsqU0F7YC33_tzvM=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,,,,,,,ChIJ0cYibuFdPToRAUT6Js9JvIc,,7 months ago,,,2023-02-08T16:33:04.754Z,5,,People also search for,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101090616891060779660?hl=en-US,,,,Gopalpur Sea Beach,,,,,,,,,,True,,,,,False,3,Tourist attraction,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNdNizEWd39asEXGbDKrrPGXnI_8DLMd9rlt_Pc=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,,,,,,,"One of the best cleaned sea beach

The ask for ticket to get inside and for amusement purpose they also have some sports as rope, cycle rope and more.
Cottages also available for staying but no Internet available hence you will get bored to use them book from Odisha tourism. The price I checked is much high not worth it.
Once visiting is good.
Natural pic for good photography.
Nice scenery available.
The steps to get to the point is approx 800.
Take breaks and reach the point and enjoy the view. In between there are small temples.

The place is close to Pipli. The village name is Hirapur n road signs showing Chausathi temple lead you to the place without any difficulty. The place is a protected monument n is beautifully well kept by the Government. The temple is built in circular fashion housing 64 Yoginis in their different avatars. Each having a unique hairstyle n riding on its own vahan (vehicle). U will see female version of Ganpati n Nrusinh as well. The pandas will give good background of the temples n it's origin. Most of these idols are damaged by Mughals but still are able to convey the everlasting hindu philosophy n cultural heritage. The lawns surrounding the temple is beautifully maintained n looks very serene. There is a modest government guest house next to the temple where I assume rooms are made available. A spiritual person will find the place very close to heart but those who are not should enjoy it as one more heritage monument with touch of our great hindu culture .....,12,37,,17,,,11,,0,,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP_TyBeO8G_sfYXWPRD7WEpKuU55eIww0r0I4mZ=w1920-h1080-k-no,,,,7,0,21,3 months ago,,Odisha,7,27

At front there is ticket counter and information center by ecotourism odisha/Hirakud wildlife division. I love this place ❤️.  When you visit deer park 🦌 next time, share your experience with me 😊

Won't have even given a single star if I had and option.
Illiterate staff
Stale food
Didn't receive first aid support for my kid for his injury for about 10-15 minutes.
Beach activity coupons were provided but we were denied service as speed boat will only move once it has 4 members, we were 3 but they denied and our coupons were wasted.

Overall pathetic experience , Would rather suggest people to go for ecotour packages they give far better service than ecoretreat

The roaring sound of the fall with dense forest all around creates a thrilling sensation. It is 18 kms from Phulbani town.

Best to go for this place by bike ride. The road is very bad, it is not good to take your car, No repair work is happening too. Many places the roads are so narrow that only one car can pass through. If car comes from opposite side, then it will be a nightmare. Take experienced drivers only.
